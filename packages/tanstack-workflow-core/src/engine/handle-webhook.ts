 * lives as a stateless HTTP handler that the streams server POSTs to
 * when external events arrive. Reads the run's history from the
 * `runStore`, replays user code, advances past the seed delivery,
 * pauses at the next awaitable, returns.
 *
 * Returns the list of events appended during this invocation —
 * useful for the caller to forward as the HTTP response body if the
 * streams server wants confirmation of the new state.
