# Execution Lanes: Managed Sessions → agent-ui Production

Doc-Class: execution
Status: active
Date: 2026-07-06
Owner: Firegrid Architecture
Substrate: S2

This is the work ledger for
[`../sdds/managed-sessions-agent-ui-sdd.md`](../sdds/managed-sessions-agent-ui-sdd.md)
(the design authority — read it first). Lanes are independent streams of work an
agent can own without coordinating beyond the interfaces below. Work packets
(WPs) are the unit of assignment: one WP ≈ one PR.

## Agent Onboarding

Read in this order before starting a WP:

1. This document (claim protocol, your lane, cross-lane interfaces).
2. The SDD section your WP implements (capability or milestone id).
3. The canon pages your WP cites — at minimum
   [`../canon/architecture/fluent/s2-substrate.md`](../canon/architecture/fluent/s2-substrate.md)
   and, for session work,
   [`../canon/architecture/fluent/execution-models.md`](../canon/architecture/fluent/execution-models.md).
4. House proof style: `apps/proofs/README.md`, then two existing proofs as
   templates — `store-object-live-fencing.ts` (multi-process + fault injection)
   and `effect-s2-substrate-proofs.ts` (substrate property style).

Ground rules:

- **Surface-first, then proof-first.** A capability WP's deliverable is the
  Target Surface (SDD section, gate G6) *and* the proof that exercises it.
  Proofs drive production modules through their public API and verify via
  workload results plus trace evidence (`traceSql`), never via test-only
  shortcuts, deep imports, or proof-only branches in production code.
- **Stay in lane.** Do not modify another lane's modules or proofs. Shared
  contracts change only through an architect gate (below).
- **Module placement and language** follow the two-zone rule in
  [`../canon/architecture/fluent/language-and-targets.md`](../canon/architecture/fluent/language-and-targets.md):
  lanes P/A/B/C are F# in `src/` (sans-IO core rule; Target Surfaces are F#
  signatures with DU-typed errors); lanes D/E are TS (Effect shapes per
  `LLMS.md`). Cross zones only via the kernel protocol or the single
  Fable-emitted package seam. Within a zone, stable seams inside existing
  packages first; promotion later.
- **Docs travel with code.** If your WP changes a contract, update the SDD's
  Implemented Assets section and (Lane F) the conformance page in the same PR.
- **Frozen paths stay frozen.** No new features on the TanStack lowering.
- Verify with the repo root `pnpm preflight` plus the proof runner for your new
  proofs.
## Claim Protocol

Claim a WP by editing the ledger row (Owner + Status: `in-progress`) in a small
standalone commit before starting. Statuses: `open` → `in-progress` →
`surface-approved` (G6 cleared and merged; implementation pending — the row
means the whole WP, never the spec alone) → `in-review` → `done` (merged,
proofs green). Blocked? Set `blocked:<reason>` and move on.
One WP per agent at a time.

## Architect Gates

Escalate to the architect (do not proceed) when a WP requires:

- G1 — Changing a cross-lane interface (below) or any record schema another
  lane consumes.
- G2 — **Decided 2026-07-06**: L1 vocabulary is an ACP session-update
  superset — see the decision record in the SDD's MS-C6 section. Deviations
  from it re-open the gate.
- G3 — Adding or weakening an RFC invariant.
- G4 — Any agent-ui production deploy (Lane E milestones; flag-gated with a
  revert path, per SDD).
- G5 — Deviating from an SDD proof obligation (renaming is fine; weakening what
  it asserts is not).
- G6 — Surface sign-off: before writing proof or implementation code for a
  capability WP, the Target Surface section in the SDD must exist and be
  architect-approved (write or update it as your WP's first commit if it is
  missing or your work changes it). Proofs then import only that public
  surface. See "Proof-Driven Development" in the repo `AGENTS.md`. F#-zone
  surfaces additionally pass the Validation Gates in
  [`../sdds/fsharp-fable-effsharp-evaluation-sdd.md`](../sdds/fsharp-fable-effsharp-evaluation-sdd.md)
  (ergonomic sample, emitted-TS sample, works-without-EffSharp proof or
  documented necessity, Fable build check, package-level EffSharp decision).

Everything else is lane-owner discretion.

## Lanes

### Lane P — Ports (language-and-targets decision)

Port the proven eff-firegrid F# assets into `src/` per the dispositions table
in the decision record: S2 client (later rev), `SubjectHistory`/`StateView`/
`KvStore`, then the `Foundation/Durable` kernel, each with its F# proofs. P3
includes the sans-IO audit: pure semantics separated from I/O shells, ambient
clock/randomness lifted to parameters. P3 lands EffSharp-free (the source
kernel is Async-based); P5 strips EffSharp from already-ported packages and
deletes the private NuGet feed. P4 supplies the mandated Fable→TS
one-seam facade for `Firegrid.Log`; its first commit is a G6 surface sketch, and
the facade shape is a cross-lane interface requiring architect review under G1
before implementation. The `durable {}` CE port follows the F# API doctrine's
CE rules (Delay/Run program-as-data, no arbitrary task binds, explicit
`Workflow.local`, Result-shaped timeouts). Ports are refactors of proven code —
behavior changes are out of scope; anything that looks like a redesign escalates
(G1/G6).

### Lane A — State Kernel (MS-C1, MS-C4)

Checkpoint/trim and StateView/projections. Pure substrate + fold work; no
session semantics. A1/A3 are independent starts. Templates: the KV-demo pattern
as specified in the SDD's MS-C4 and the eff-firegrid foundational SDD's
`SubjectHistory`/`StateView` shapes (version = exclusive upper bound —
non-negotiable convention).

### Lane B — Turn Streams + Lifecycle (MS-C2, MS-C5)

The managed-session storage and authority primitives, per the actor
composition in
[`../canon/architecture/fluent/authority-and-actors.md`](../canon/architecture/fluent/authority-and-actors.md):
B1's generic core is the `Authority` protocol (I5) — claim, epoch deposal,
seal — with `DurableLog` as SubjectHistory + Authority + seal and Turn as a
pure binding. B1 defines both I5 and the turn-stream schema (I1), so its
surface PR needs architect sign-off (G1) before B2–B4 and Lane E build on it.
Cancel in B3 is a mailbox send, not a bespoke control channel. The
deposed-producer proof should extend the technique in
`store-object-live-fencing.ts` (two process hosts, real kill).

### Lane C — Wake Path (MS-C3)

Tail-driven wake router + timer index. Independent of A/B/D until integration;
sweeps and their proofs remain green as the degraded mode. The latency bound in
`wake.tail-latency` is asserted from trace evidence — pick and record the bound
in the proof.

### Lane D — Harness Adapter (MS-C6)

Blocked at start by gate G2 (L1 vocabulary decision). D2's fixture-replay
harness is the lane's main artifact: recorded harness transcripts as fixtures,
deterministic adapter reconstruction as the proof. D3 must cover subagent
scoping (`parent_tool_use_id`) and usage/cost facts — both are current agent-ui
defects, so fixtures should include them.

### Lane E — agent-ui Integration (MS-M1–M5)

Lives in `home-observability-stack` (`apps/agent-ui`); tracked here. Each WP:
flag-gated, one-deploy revert, regression list from the SDD run against the new
path, links its PR back to this ledger. Friction with a platform API is
reported as a requirements delta
([`../requirements/agent-ui-stress-test.md`](../requirements/agent-ui-stress-test.md))
or a new proof obligation — never worked around locally.

### Lane F — Spec/Conformance Upkeep (RFC)

Keeps [`../rfc/agent-substrate/operating/conformance.md`](../rfc/agent-substrate/operating/conformance.md)
truthful: every invariant maps to a named green proof; aspirational pages say
so. F1 is high-leverage and unblocked today.

## Cross-Lane Interfaces

Changes to any of these require gate G1:

- **I5 — `Authority` protocol** (B1). Claim/epoch-deposal/seal over a subject;
  consumed by B3 (lifecycle), C1 (router leadership), A2 (checkpoint
  election). See
  [`../canon/architecture/fluent/authority-and-actors.md`](../canon/architecture/fluent/authority-and-actors.md).
- **I1 — Generic `DurableLog` surface + Turn binding schema** (B1). The
  generic sealed-log API and the turn address/chunk/terminal schemas bound to
  it. Consumed by Lanes A (history fold), D (adapter emits into turns), E
  (attach). Domain methods on the binding are a G1 violation.
- **I2 — L1 observation vocabulary** (D1). Consumed by A4 (history fold) and E4
  (UI fold).
- **I3 — Wake record shape + shard naming** (C1). Consumed by B3 (lifecycle
  wakes) and future temporal features.
- **I4 — Checkpoint record shape** (A1). Consumed by A4 and any long-lived fold.

## Suggested Parallel Start

Start with the ports: P1 immediately, P2 behind it (they are refactors of
proven code — the safest warm-up for the F# zone), with F1 and D1's decision
record (gate G2) in parallel. A1/A3/B1 open when P2 lands; C1 when P1 lands;
E1 when B2 is green. B1's schema gets early architect review — it unblocks the
most.
