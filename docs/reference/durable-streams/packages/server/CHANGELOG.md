## 0.3.6

### Patch Changes

- fix: close conformance gaps around soft-delete, fork content-type, and live SSE closure ([#376](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/376))

  Server conformance tests:
  - Add a test asserting a live SSE reader caught up at the tail receives
    data appended atomically with a stream close (POST + `Stream-Closed`)
    before the closing control event. A server that emits the
    `streamClosed` control without first delivering the final append
    silently loses the last message; the test probes a spread of close
    timings to catch the race deterministically.
  - Add a test asserting a fork rejected for a content-type mismatch does
    not leak a reference on the source (the source must still fully delete
    rather than being pinned in a soft-deleted state).

  Reference server:
  - Fix a reference-count leak in both the in-memory and file-backed
    stores: a fork rejected for a content-type mismatch incremented the
    source's `refCount` before validating the content type, pinning the
    source in a soft-deleted state forever. Content-type is now validated
    before the reference is taken.

- Updated dependencies [[`cdb142e`](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/commit/cdb142e24fd8f005d827b4b37035b00c848ff523), [`8b33e59`](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/commit/8b33e5929dddaae8b529fd561d024b832a861eaf)]:

## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- feat(server): support `Stream-Fork-Sub-Offset` for arbitrary-position forks ([#347](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/347))

  Adds a new optional header on fork-creation `PUT` requests that refines
  the divergence point past `Stream-Fork-Offset` to a sub-position the
  server has not previously minted. The integer is interpreted per the
  source stream's content type:
  - `application/json` — number of flattened messages to inherit past the
    anchor offset.
  - All other content types — number of decoded entity body bytes to
    inherit past the anchor offset.

  Sub-offset is a separate addressing dimension alongside the opaque
  offset and does not violate offset opacity, uniqueness, or
  strict-monotonicity (PROTOCOL.md §6). Servers materialize the resolved
  prefix into the fork's segment at creation time; reads on the resulting
  fork are unchanged.

  See PROTOCOL.md §4.2 for full semantics. This change ships fork-only;
  sub-offset support for read operations is reserved for a future
  revision.

- Fix idempotent producer auto-claim sequencing so later batches wait for the ([#371](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/371))
  first running batch to claim its epoch before reserving and sending subsequent
  sequence numbers. `flush()` now also waits for batches held behind the initial
  auto-claim barrier.
- Updated dependencies [[`92c0821`](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/commit/92c082152f7be8327f0c055d8b224494e5e71f76)]:
  - @durable-streams/client@0.2.6
  - @durable-streams/state@0.2.9

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- Restore the TypeScript client surface expected by Durable Streams consumers: ([#369](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/369))
  publish the SSE control-event constants from the package entrypoint and expose
  `IdempotentProducer.lastSuccessfulOffset` after successful writes or closes.

  Republish the server against the fixed client package so `DurableStreamTestServer`
  can import the SSE constants from `@durable-streams/client`.

- Updated dependencies [[`6afab5f`](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/commit/6afab5f8258999ff1794749ad9d0d9bd0c823625)]:
  - @durable-streams/client@0.2.5
  - @durable-streams/state@0.2.8

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- feat(server): add reserved subscription APIs ([#361](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/361))

  The protocol now reserves `/v1/stream/__ds/*` for subscription control APIs.
  The TypeScript server implements webhook and pull-wake subscription lifecycle,
  stream membership, webhook callback ack, pull-wake claim/ack/release, and JWKS
  discovery for webhook signature verification.

  The server conformance package now includes opt-in coverage for the reserved
  subscription APIs.

- fix(server): sign subscription webhooks with discoverable public keys ([#361](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/361))

  Webhook subscriptions now use Ed25519 request signatures and expose the
  server's public verification keys from the Durable Streams control namespace,
  removing the need for receivers to store per-subscription shared secrets.

- fix(server): flatten file-backed stream storage ([#360](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/360))

  The file-backed store now uses one segment log file per stream instead of a
  nested per-stream directory, keeps offsets aligned to the actual frame layout,
  and tightens crash recovery around truncated frames.

  This also adds focused read/create microbench scripts for evaluating the file
  store path and restores the server package typecheck configuration.

- Updated dependencies [[`feb0c4c`](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/commit/feb0c4cc7d69278f0f0ed398b3618f74fd1ed24d)]:

  - @durable-streams/client@0.2.4

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- fix(server): serialize concurrent appends to the same stream ([#340](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/340))

  Without per-stream serialization, the file-backed `append()` had a race
  in the read-modify-write of `streamMeta.currentOffset`: two concurrent
  appenders could read the same starting offset, both compute the same
  `newOffset`, both write a frame to the segment file, and only one's
  LMDB metadata update would win. The file then contained two frames at
  positions past the LMDB-tracked `currentOffset`, so subsequent
  `getTailOffset` lookups (and `stream-next-offset` headers) lagged the
  actual stream contents — causing valid `done`-callback acks at offsets
  that the server's stale tail had never seen to be rejected with
  `INVALID_OFFSET`.

  Reproduced with N concurrent appends to one stream collapsing to a
  single offset value (added as a regression test in
  `packages/server/test/file-backed.test.ts`). The fix wraps `append()`
  in a per-stream lock (mirrors `acquireProducerLock`), so the
  read-currentOffset → write-frame → fsync → put-LMDB sequence runs
  atomically per stream.

- fix(server): fork PUT inherits source content type when Content-Type header is omitted ([#342](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/342))

  Per the protocol (Section 4.2), when forking a stream the `Content-Type` header is
  optional — an omitted header means "inherit from source." The TS dev server was
  defaulting empty Content-Type to `application/octet-stream` before the store could
  inherit, causing fork creation to fail with `409 Conflict` (content-type mismatch)
  whenever the source's content type differed from the default.

  Adds a server conformance test (`Fork - Creation > should fork inheriting
content-type when header omitted`) that exercises this behavior end-to-end:
  fork response, HEAD, and a follow-up POST with the inherited content type.

- Updated dependencies [[`a3ed371`](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/commit/a3ed371a56b28ec6abc00ecdd149e2e030710cf6), [`346bc42`](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/commit/346bc426f5e13705cdd5e0cc5f7a759c7735a888)]:

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: TTL sliding window renewal — Stream-TTL now resets on read and write, with conformance tests for expiration, renewal, and fork TTL behavior. Conformance tests hardened against timing flakiness (polling-based expiry checks, wider Expires-At windows, fast-check time limits). ([#321](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/321))

### Patch Changes

- feat: add stream forking — create forks via PUT with Stream-Forked-From header, transparent read stitching, stream-level refcounting, soft-delete with cascading GC ([#312](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/312))

- Updated dependencies [[`e2f0586`](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/commit/e2f05862b7068a9537b1d97fb481799b852581d6)]:

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Remove `encoding` option from SSE reads. Servers now automatically base64-encode binary content types and signal this via the `Stream-SSE-Data-Encoding: base64` response header. Clients decode automatically when this header is present. ([#231](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/231))

- added support for base64 encoding over sse ([#223](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/223))

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Add Kafka-style idempotent producers for exactly-once write semantics. ([#140](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/140))

  **Server:**
  - Producer state tracking with `Producer-Id`, `Producer-Epoch`, `Producer-Seq` headers
  - Duplicate detection returns 204 (idempotent success)
  - Zombie fencing via epoch validation (403 on stale epoch)
  - Sequence gap detection (409 with expected/received seq)
  - Per-producer serialization for concurrent request handling

  **Client:**
  - New `IdempotentProducer` class with batching and pipelining
  - Fire-and-forget API with automatic deduplication
  - Configurable `maxBatchBytes`, `lingerMs`, `maxInFlight`
  - Auto-claim flow for ephemeral producers
  - `StaleEpochError` and `SequenceGapError` for error handling

  **Protocol:**
  - New section 5.2.1 documenting idempotent producer semantics

- Updated dependencies [[`67b5a4d`](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/commit/67b5a4dcaae69dbe651dc6ede3cac72d3390567f)]:
  - @durable-streams/client@0.1.4
  - @durable-streams/state@0.1.4

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Add advanced fault injection and conformance tests ([#119](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/119))

  Server fault injection improvements:
  - Extended fault injection with new capabilities: delayMs, dropConnection, truncateBodyBytes, probability, method filtering, corruptBody, and jitterMs
  - Updated /\_test/inject-error endpoint to accept all new fault parameters
  - Added body modification support for response truncation and corruption

  New server conformance tests:
  - Concurrent writer stress tests (seq conflicts, racing writers, mixed readers/writers)
  - State hash verification tests (replay consistency, deterministic ordering)

  New client conformance tests:
  - 8 fault injection test cases covering delay recovery, connection drops, method-specific faults, and retry scenarios

- Add browser security headers per Protocol Section 10.7: ([#113](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/113))
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on all responses
  - `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` on all responses
  - `Cache-Control: no-store` on HEAD responses

  Includes conformance tests for security header presence on GET, PUT, POST, HEAD, SSE, long-poll, and error responses.

- Standardize HTTP status codes for protocol operations ([#106](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/106))
  - Append (POST): Now mandates `204 No Content` (previously allowed 200 or 204)
  - Idempotent create (PUT): Now mandates `200 OK` (previously allowed 200 or 204)

  This removes ambiguity from the protocol. Clients should already accept these status codes.

- Updated dependencies [[`8d06625`](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/commit/8d06625eba26d79b7c5d317adf89047f6b44c8ce), [`8f500cf`](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/commit/8f500cf720e59ada83188ed67f244a40c4b04422)]:

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Add TTL expiration conformance tests and implement expiration in stores ([#101](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/101))
  - Add 7 new conformance tests verifying streams return 404 after TTL/Expires-At passes
  - Add "recreate after expiry" test ensuring expired streams don't block new stream creation
  - Add 4 new TTL format validation tests (leading zeros, plus sign, decimal, scientific notation)
  - Implement expiration checking in both in-memory and file-backed stores
  - Fix: expired streams no longer block PUT to recreate at same path
  - Fix: malformed Expires-At dates now treated as expired (fail closed)
