# @durable-streams/state

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Mark `@tanstack/db` as an optional peer dependency. The TanStack DB surface lives behind the `@durable-streams/state/db` subpath and the main entry is db-free, so consumers that don't use the reactive layer no longer get unmet-peer warnings (or errors under strict pnpm). ([#383](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/383))

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- feat(state)!: move the TanStack DB-backed surface to a `@durable-streams/state/db` subpath ([#382](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/382))

  The main `@durable-streams/state` entry is now free of `@tanstack/db`. It exposes only the db-free protocol surface — `createStateSchema` and its change-event helpers, `MaterializedState`, and the state-event types/guards — so producers and backends (e.g. `@durable-streams/server`) can depend on it without the `@tanstack/db` peer dependency installed. Previously the entry eagerly re-exported `@tanstack/db`, so importing anything from the package forced that peer to be resolvable, breaking publishable dependents that don't use the reactive layer.

  The reactive, TanStack DB-backed layer now lives at `@durable-streams/state/db`:
  - `createStreamDB`, `getStreamDBCollectionId`, and the `StreamDB*` / `Action*` types
  - the convenience re-exports of `@tanstack/db` (`createCollection`, `createOptimisticAction`, `eq`, `and`, `count`, …)

  The subpath is a strict superset of the main entry (it also re-exports `createStateSchema`), so existing reactive consumers only change the import path:

  ```diff
  -import { createStateSchema, createStreamDB } from "@durable-streams/state"
  +import { createStateSchema, createStreamDB } from "@durable-streams/state/db"
  ```

  BREAKING CHANGE: `createStreamDB`, `getStreamDBCollectionId`, the StreamDB/Action types, and the `@tanstack/db` re-exports are no longer exported from `@durable-streams/state`. Import them from `@durable-streams/state/db` instead. The db-free APIs (`createStateSchema`, `MaterializedState`, event types/guards) are unchanged on the main entry.

- Move `@tanstack/db` from a regular dependency to a peer dependency (`>=0.6.0 <1.0.0`). ([#381](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/381))

  `@tanstack/db` is a singleton: collections, transactions, and live queries rely on `instanceof` checks and module-level shared state, so two copies in a dependency tree don't interoperate. Pinning it as a regular dependency (`^0.6.0`) meant that as soon as a consuming app upgraded `@tanstack/react-db` (which pins `@tanstack/db` at an exact version per release) past the `0.6` line, the app's copy and `state`'s copy diverged into two instances — breaking StreamDB collections at runtime.

  Declaring it as a peer dependency makes `state` bind to the single `@tanstack/db` the consuming app already has, and the permissive range keeps that binding valid as the app moves across `0.x` minors.

  **Breaking change:** consumers must now install `@tanstack/db` themselves (any `>=0.6.0 <1.0.0`). Apps already depending on `@tanstack/db` or `@tanstack/react-db` are unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- Fix idempotent producer auto-claim sequencing so later batches wait for the ([#371](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/371))
  first running batch to claim its epoch before reserving and sending subsequent
  sequence numbers. `flush()` now also waits for batches held behind the initial
  auto-claim barrier.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- feat(state): expose StreamDB offsets and subscription hooks ([#365](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/365))

  StreamDB can now reuse an existing DurableStream instance, expose the latest
  consumed offset, and notify callers around JSON stream batches. Collection IDs
  are scoped by stream URL to avoid cross-stream collisions, and live replayed
  inserts are normalized to updates when they match existing rows.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- Add first-class live mode configuration to `createStreamDB()` so callers can force `"sse"` or `"long-poll"`, and add `headers` to `IdempotentProducerOptions` for producer batch and close requests. ([#353](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/353))

### Patch Changes

- docs(stream-db): show list query pattern for useLiveQuery ([#333](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/333))

  Added list query example with `{ data }` destructuring and default empty array alongside the existing findOne pattern. Prevents agents from writing `allSessions.map(...)` instead of `const { data: allSessions = [] } = useLiveQuery(...)`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- **BREAKING**: Make `@tanstack/db` a peer dependency instead of a regular dependency. ([#187](https://github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/pull/187))

  This fixes TypeScript type compatibility issues when using StreamDB collections with TanStack DB's query utilities like `useLiveQuery` from `@tanstack/react-db`.

  **Migration**: Users must now install `@tanstack/db` alongside `@durable-streams/state`:

  ```bash
  pnpm add @durable-streams/state @tanstack/db
  ```

  **Why this change?**

  The `Collection` class in `@tanstack/db` has private properties. TypeScript uses nominal typing for private properties, meaning when two packages bundle the same class, TypeScript treats them as distinct types. This caused type errors like:

  ```
  Type 'Collection<...>' is not assignable to type 'CollectionImpl<...>'.
  Types have separate declarations of a private property '_events'.
  ```

  By making `@tanstack/db` a peer dependency, there's only one copy installed, and all packages reference the same module - making the types compatible.

  **Convenience re-exports**: Key utilities from `@tanstack/db` are now re-exported for convenience:
  - Types: `Collection`, `SyncConfig`
  - Comparison operators: `eq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `like`, `ilike`, `inArray`
  - Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
  - Null checking: `isNull`, `isUndefined`
  - Aggregate functions: `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`
