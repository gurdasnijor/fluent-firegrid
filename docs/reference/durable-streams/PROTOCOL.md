## Abstract

This document specifies the Durable Streams Protocol, an HTTP-based protocol for creating, appending to, and reading from durable, append-only byte streams. The protocol provides a simple, web-native primitive for applications requiring ordered, replayable data streams with support for catch-up reads, live tailing, and explicit stream closure (EOF). It is designed to be a foundation for higher-level abstractions such as event sourcing, database synchronization, collaborative editing, AI conversation histories, and finite response streaming.

## 1. Introduction

Modern web and cloud applications frequently require ordered, durable sequences of data that can be replayed from arbitrary points and tailed in real time. Common use cases include:

- Database synchronization and change feeds
- Event-sourced architectures
- Collaborative editing and CRDTs
- AI conversation histories and token streaming
- Workflow execution histories
- Real-time application state updates
- Finite response streaming (proxied HTTP responses, job outputs, file transfers)

While these patterns are widespread, the web platform lacks a simple, first-class primitive for durable streams. Applications typically implement ad-hoc solutions using combinations of databases, queues, and polling mechanisms, each reinventing similar offset-based replay semantics.

The Durable Streams Protocol provides a minimal HTTP-based interface for durable, append-only byte streams. It is intentionally low-level and byte-oriented, allowing higher-level abstractions to be built on top without protocol changes.

## 2. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

**Stream**: A URL-addressable, append-only byte stream that can be read and written to. A stream is simply a URL; the protocol defines how to interact with that URL using HTTP methods, query parameters, and headers. Streams are durable and immutable by position; new data can only be appended.

**Offset**: An opaque, lexicographically sortable token that identifies a position within a stream. Clients use offsets to resume reading from a specific previously reached point.

**Content Type**: A MIME type set on stream creation that describes the format of the stream's bytes. The content type is returned on reads and may be used by clients to interpret message boundaries.

**Tail Offset**: The offset immediately after the last byte in the stream. This is the position where new appends will be written.

**Closed Stream**: A stream that has been explicitly closed by a writer. Once closed, a stream is in a terminal state: no further appends are permitted, and readers can observe the closure as an end-of-stream (EOF) signal. Closure is durable and monotonic — once closed, a stream remains closed.

**Fork**: A stream created by referencing a source stream and a divergence offset. The fork inherits data from the source up to the fork offset without copying it. Reads on a fork transparently stitch source and fork data.

**Fork Offset**: The divergence point in the source stream at which a fork branches. Data at offsets before the fork offset comes from the source; data at offsets at or after the fork offset comes from the fork's own storage.

**Source Stream**: The stream from which a fork inherits data. A source stream may itself be a fork, forming a fork chain.

**Reference Count**: The number of forks that reference a given stream as their source. Used to determine whether a stream can be fully deleted or must be soft-deleted.

**Soft-Deleted Stream**: A stream that has been deleted by its owner but is retained because active forks still reference its data. A soft-deleted stream returns `410 Gone` for all client-facing operations on its URL (`GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, `DELETE`), but the server retains its data internally for fork reads.

## 3. Protocol Overview

The Durable Streams Protocol is an HTTP-based protocol that operates on URLs. A stream is simply a URL; the protocol defines how to interact with that URL using standard HTTP methods, query parameters, and custom headers.

The protocol defines operations to create, append to, read, close, delete, and query metadata for streams. Reads have three modes: catch-up, long-poll, and Server-Sent Events (SSE). The primary operations are:

1. **Create**: Establish a new stream at a URL with optional initial content (PUT)
2. **Append**: Add bytes to the end of an existing stream (POST)
3. **Close**: Transition a stream to closed state, optionally with a final append (POST with `Stream-Closed: true`)
4. **Read**: Retrieve bytes starting from a given offset, with support for catch-up and live modes (GET)
5. **Delete**: Remove a stream (DELETE)
6. **Head**: Query stream metadata without transferring data (HEAD)

The protocol does not prescribe a specific URL structure. Servers may organize streams using any URL scheme they choose (e.g., `/v1/stream/{path}`, `/streams/{id}`, or domain-specific paths). The protocol is defined by the HTTP methods, query parameters, and headers applied to any stream URL.

Streams support arbitrary content types. The protocol operates at the byte level, leaving message framing and schema interpretation to clients.

**Independent Read/Write Implementation**: Servers **MAY** implement the read and write paths independently. For example, a database synchronization server may only implement the read path and use its own injection system for writes, while a collaborative editing service might implement both paths.

## 4. Stream Model

A stream is an append-only sequence of bytes with the following properties:

- **Durability**: Once written and acknowledged, bytes persist until the stream is deleted or expired
- **Immutability by Position**: Bytes at a given offset never change; new data is only appended
- **Ordering**: Bytes are strictly ordered by offset
- **Content Type**: Each stream has a MIME content type set at creation
- **TTL/Expiry**: Streams may have a sliding time-to-live window (resets on each read or write) or an absolute expiry time
- **Retention**: Servers **MAY** implement retention policies that drop data older than a certain age while the stream continues. If a stream is deleted a new stream **SHOULD NOT** be created at the same URL.
- **Stream State**: A stream is either **open** (accepts appends) or **closed** (no further appends permitted). Streams start in the open state and transition to closed via an explicit close operation. This transition is **durable** (persisted) and **monotonic** (once closed, a stream cannot be reopened).

Clients track their position in a stream using offsets. Offsets are opaque to clients but are lexicographically sortable, allowing clients to determine ordering and resume from any point.

### 4.1. Stream Closure

Stream closure provides an explicit end-of-stream (EOF) signal that allows readers to distinguish between "no data yet" and "no more data ever." This is essential for finite streams where writers need to signal completion, such as:

- Proxied HTTP responses that have finished streaming
- Completed job outputs or workflow executions
- Finalized conversation histories or document streams

**Properties of stream closure:**

- **Durable**: The closed state is persisted and survives server restarts
- **Monotonic**: Once closed, a stream cannot be reopened
- **Idempotent**: Closing an already-closed stream succeeds (or returns a stable "already closed" response)
- **Observable**: Readers can detect closure and treat it as EOF
- **Atomic with final append**: Writers can atomically append a final message and close in a single operation

After closure, the stream's data remains fully readable. Only new appends are rejected.

**Stream-Closed Header Value:**

The `Stream-Closed` header uses the value `true` (case-insensitive) to indicate closure. Servers **MUST** treat the header as present only when its value is exactly `true` (case-insensitive comparison). Other values such as `false`, `yes`, `1`, or empty string **MUST** be treated as if the header were absent. Servers **SHOULD NOT** return error responses for non-`true` values; they simply ignore the header.

### 4.2. Stream forking

Stream forking creates a new stream that references the data of a source stream up to a specified offset. The fork is a variant of stream creation — a `PUT` with additional headers. Once created, the fork behaves as an independent stream: it has its own URL, accepts appends, and can be closed or deleted without affecting the source. Reads on a fork return the inherited data followed by any data appended to the fork itself. How the server provides access to the source data is an implementation detail — it may use copy-on-fork, pointer-based stitching, or any other mechanism.

#### Fork creation headers

These headers are used on `PUT` requests to create a forked stream:

- `Stream-Forked-From: <source-path>`: The path component of the source stream's URL, relative to the same server. When present, the `PUT` creates a fork rather than a new empty stream. Cross-service forking is not supported — the source stream must be on the same server as the fork.
- `Stream-Fork-Offset: <offset>`: The divergence point in the source stream. The fork inherits all data from the source up to (but not including) this offset. If omitted, defaults to the source stream's current tail offset.
- `Stream-Fork-Sub-Offset: <integer>` (optional): A non-negative integer that refines the divergence point to a sub-position past `Stream-Fork-Offset`. Interpreted per the source stream's content type:
  - For `application/json` streams: number of flattened messages (Section 7.1) to inherit past the anchor.
  - For all other content types: number of decoded entity body bytes to inherit past the anchor, exclusive of any framing the server uses internally and independent of any HTTP transfer or content encoding used in transit.
  - Default `0`. A request with sub-offset `0` is equivalent to a request with the header omitted.
  - The sub-offset is a separate addressing dimension and is not part of the offset value (see Section 6).

When forking, the `Content-Type` header is optional — if omitted, the fork inherits the source stream's content type. If provided, it **MUST** match the source stream's content type; servers **MUST** return `409 Conflict` if it differs. Forks have independent lifetimes and can outlive their source stream. Fork TTL/expiry follows this table:

| Source     | Fork request | Fork gets                   | Rationale                                    |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| No expiry  | No expiry    | No expiry                   | Nothing to inherit or set                    |
| No expiry  | TTL          | Own TTL                     | Fork's own sliding window                    |
| No expiry  | Expires-At   | Own Expires-At              | Fork's own hard deadline                     |
| TTL        | No expiry    | Inherit source's TTL value  | Same sliding window, refreshed independently |
| TTL        | TTL          | Requested TTL               | Fork's own sliding window                    |
| TTL        | Expires-At   | Requested Expires-At        | Fork's own hard deadline                     |
| Expires-At | No expiry    | Inherit source's Expires-At | Prevents unbounded retention                 |
| Expires-At | TTL          | Requested TTL               | Fork lives independently                     |
| Expires-At | Expires-At   | Requested Expires-At        | Fork can outlive parent                      |

#### Fork creation errors

Fork creation may return the standard stream creation errors from Section 5.1 (such as `409 Conflict` for content-type mismatch or `400 Bad Request` for invalid TTL/expiry), plus the following fork-specific errors:

| Condition                         | Status          | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source stream not found           | 404 Not Found   | The `Stream-Forked-From` path does not exist                                                         |
| Fork offset beyond stream length  | 400 Bad Request | The `Stream-Fork-Offset` exceeds the source stream's current tail                                    |
| Invalid offset format             | 400 Bad Request | The `Stream-Fork-Offset` value is malformed                                                          |
| Sub-offset overshoot or invalid   | 400 Bad Request | The `Stream-Fork-Sub-Offset` is malformed, negative, or names a position past the next data boundary |
| Content-Type mismatch with source | 409 Conflict    | Provided `Content-Type` differs from the source stream's type                                        |
| Target path already in use        | 409 Conflict    | A stream already exists at the target URL with different config                                      |
| Source is soft-deleted            | 409 Conflict    | The source stream has been deleted but still has forks                                               |

#### Idempotent fork creation

Fork creation follows the same idempotency rules as regular stream creation (Section 5.1). If a stream already exists at the target URL with matching configuration — including `Stream-Forked-From` and `Stream-Fork-Offset` — the server **MUST** return `200 OK`. If the configuration differs, the server **MUST** return `409 Conflict`.

#### Closed stream forking

Closed streams **MAY** be forked. The resulting fork starts in the open state regardless of the source stream's closed status. This enables forking from historical points in completed streams.

#### Producer state and fork boundaries

Forks **MUST NOT** inherit idempotent producer state (Section 5.2.1) or per-writer `Stream-Seq` state (Section 5.2) from the source. A fork is a new stream from a writer-state perspective; producers writing to the fork **MUST** re-bootstrap their state on the fork (typically by bumping their epoch). This applies to all forks, including those created with `Stream-Fork-Sub-Offset` whose boundary lies inside a producer batch on the source — the source's producer state is unchanged, and the fork's writer-state-fresh shape ensures retries against the fork cannot collide with the partial inherited data.

#### Soft-delete and lifecycle

When a stream with active forks (reference count > 0) is deleted via `DELETE`, it transitions to a **soft-deleted** state:

- Direct client access to the stream's URL returns `410 Gone` for all operations (`GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, `DELETE`)
- The stream's path is blocked from re-creation via `PUT` (`409 Conflict`)
- The server retains the stream's data internally so that fork reads can stitch inherited data — this is transparent to clients reading from forks
- When the last fork referencing the stream is deleted, the server cleans up the stream's data. This cleanup **MAY** occur asynchronously — clients **SHOULD NOT** assume the source returns `404` immediately after the fork's `DELETE` response.

Garbage collection cascades: if deleting a fork causes its source's reference count to reach zero and the source is also soft-deleted, the source is cleaned up too. This cascade continues up the fork chain. Cascade cleanup **MAY** also occur asynchronously.

## 5. HTTP Operations

The protocol defines operations that are applied to a stream URL. The examples in this section use `{stream-url}` to represent any stream URL. Servers may implement any URL structure they choose; the protocol is defined by the HTTP methods, query parameters, and headers.

### 5.1. Create Stream

#### Request

```
PUT {stream-url}
```

Where `{stream-url}` is any URL that identifies the stream to be created.

Creates a new stream. If the stream already exists at `{stream-url}`, the server **MUST** either:

- return `200 OK` if the existing stream's configuration (content type, TTL/expiry, and closure status) matches the request, or
- return `409 Conflict` if it does not.

This provides idempotent "create or ensure exists" semantics aligned with HTTP PUT expectations.

**Closure status matching:** When checking for idempotent success (200 OK), servers **MUST** compare the `Stream-Closed` header in the request against the stream's current closure status. For example:

- `PUT /stream` (no `Stream-Closed`) to an **open** stream with matching config → `200 OK`
- `PUT /stream` (no `Stream-Closed`) to a **closed** stream → `409 Conflict` (closure status mismatch)
- `PUT /stream + Stream-Closed: true` to a **closed** stream with matching config → `200 OK`
- `PUT /stream + Stream-Closed: true` to an **open** stream → `409 Conflict` (closure status mismatch)

#### Request Headers (Optional)

- `Content-Type: <stream-content-type>`
  - Sets the stream's content type. If omitted, the server **MAY** default to `application/octet-stream`.

- `Stream-TTL: <seconds>`
  - Sets a sliding time-to-live window in seconds. The stream expires after being idle (no reads or writes) for this duration. Each read or write operation resets the expiry countdown to this value. `HEAD` requests do **not** reset the countdown. The value **MUST** be a non-negative integer in decimal notation without leading zeros, plus signs, decimal points, or scientific notation (e.g., `3600` is valid; `+3600`, `03600`, `3600.0`, and `3.6e3` are not).
  - TTL resets are a server-side concern: only requests that reach the origin server reset the countdown. Reads served from intermediate caches (CDN catch-up reads with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=60`) do not reach the server and do not reset the TTL. For live read modes (long-poll, SSE), the TTL resets when the server begins processing the request, not when data is delivered or the response completes. This means a stream with active live readers will not expire, even if no new data is being produced.

- `Stream-Expires-At: <rfc3339>`
  - Sets an absolute expiry time as an RFC 3339 timestamp.
  - If both `Stream-TTL` and `Stream-Expires-At` are supplied, servers **SHOULD** reject the request with `400 Bad Request`. Implementations **MAY** define a deterministic precedence rule, but **MUST** document it.

- `Stream-Closed: true` (optional)
  - When present, the stream is created in the **closed** state. Any body provided becomes the complete and final content of the stream.
  - This enables atomic "create and close" semantics for single-message or empty streams that are immediately complete (e.g., cached responses, placeholder errors, pre-computed results).
  - **Examples:**
    - `PUT /stream + Stream-Closed: true` (empty body): Creates an empty, immediately-closed stream (useful for "completed with no output" or error placeholders).
    - `PUT /stream + Stream-Closed: true + body`: Creates a single-shot stream with the body as its complete content (useful for cached responses, pre-computed results).

- `Stream-Forked-From` (optional): When present, the `PUT` creates a fork rather than a new empty stream. The value is the URL path of the source stream. See Section 4.2 for fork semantics.
- `Stream-Fork-Offset` (optional, requires `Stream-Forked-From`): The divergence point in the source stream. If omitted, defaults to the source stream's current tail offset. Servers **MUST** return `400 Bad Request` if the offset exceeds the source stream's tail.
- `Stream-Fork-Sub-Offset` (optional, requires `Stream-Forked-From`): A non-negative integer refining the divergence point past `Stream-Fork-Offset`. See Section 4.2 for content-type-driven semantics.

#### Request Body (Optional)

- Initial stream bytes. If provided, these bytes form the first content of the stream.

#### Response Codes

- `201 Created`: Stream created successfully
- `200 OK`: Stream already exists with matching configuration (idempotent success)
- `409 Conflict`: Stream already exists with different configuration
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid headers or parameters (including conflicting TTL/expiry)
- `404 Not Found`: Source stream specified by `Stream-Forked-From` does not exist (fork creation only)
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded

#### Response Headers (on 201 or 200)

- `Location: {stream-url}` (on 201): Servers **SHOULD** include a `Location` header equal to `{stream-url}` in `201 Created` responses.
- `Content-Type: <stream-content-type>`: The stream's content type
- `Stream-Next-Offset: <offset>`: The tail offset after any initial content
- `Stream-Closed: true`: Present when the stream was created in the closed state

### 5.2. Append to Stream

#### Request

```
POST {stream-url}
```

Where `{stream-url}` is the URL of an existing stream.

Appends bytes to the end of an existing stream. Supports both full-body and streaming (chunked) append operations. Optionally closes the stream atomically with the append.

Servers that do not support appends for a given stream **SHOULD** return `405 Method Not Allowed` or `501 Not Implemented` to `POST` requests on that URL.

#### Request Headers

- `Content-Type: <stream-content-type>`
  - **MUST** match the stream's existing content type when a body is provided. Servers **MUST** return `409 Conflict` when the content type is valid but does not match the stream's configured type.
  - **MAY** be omitted when the request body is empty (i.e., close-only requests with `Stream-Closed: true`). When the request body is empty, servers **MUST NOT** reject based on `Content-Type` and **MAY** ignore it entirely. This ensures close-only requests remain robust even when clients/libraries attach default `Content-Type` headers.

- `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` (optional)
  - Indicates a streaming body. Servers **SHOULD** support HTTP/1.1 chunked encoding and HTTP/2 streaming semantics.

- `Stream-Seq: <string>` (optional)
  - A monotonic, lexicographic writer sequence number for coordination.
  - `Stream-Seq` values are opaque strings that **MUST** compare using simple byte-wise lexicographic ordering. Sequence numbers are scoped per authenticated writer identity (or per stream, depending on implementation). Servers **MUST** document the scope they enforce.
  - If provided and less than or equal to the last appended sequence (as determined by lexicographic comparison), the server **MUST** return `409 Conflict`. Sequence numbers **MUST** be strictly increasing.

- `Stream-Closed: true` (optional)
  - When present with value `true`, the stream is **closed** after the append completes. This is an atomic operation: the body (if any) is appended as the final data, and the stream transitions to the closed state in the same step.
  - If the request body is empty (Content-Length: 0 or no body), the stream is closed without appending any data. This is the only case where an empty POST body is valid.
  - Once closed, the stream rejects all subsequent appends with `409 Conflict` (see below).
  - **Close-only requests are idempotent**: if the stream is already closed and the request includes `Stream-Closed: true` with an empty body, servers **SHOULD** return `204 No Content` with `Stream-Closed: true`.
  - **Append-and-close requests are NOT idempotent** (without idempotent producer headers): if the stream is already closed and the request includes a body but no idempotent producer headers, servers **MUST** return `409 Conflict` with `Stream-Closed: true`, since the body cannot be appended. However, if idempotent producer semantics apply and the request matches the `(producerId, epoch, seq)` tuple that performed the closing append, servers treat it as a deduplicated success (see Section 5.2.1).

#### Request Body

- Bytes to append to the stream. Servers **MUST** reject POST requests with an empty body (Content-Length: 0 or no body) with `400 Bad Request`, **unless** the `Stream-Closed: true` header is present (which allows closing without appending data).

#### Response Codes

- `204 No Content`: Append successful (or stream already closed when closing idempotently)
- `400 Bad Request`: Malformed request (invalid header syntax, missing Content-Type, empty body without `Stream-Closed: true`)
- `404 Not Found`: Stream does not exist
- `405 Method Not Allowed` or `501 Not Implemented`: Append not supported for this stream
- `409 Conflict`: Content type mismatch with stream's configured type, sequence regression (if `Stream-Seq` provided), or **stream is closed** (when attempting to append without `Stream-Closed: true`)
- `410 Gone`: Stream is soft-deleted
- `413 Payload Too Large`: Request body exceeds server limits
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded

#### Response Headers (on success)

- `Stream-Next-Offset: <offset>`: The new tail offset after the append
- `Stream-Closed: true`: Present when the stream is now closed (either by this request or previously)

#### Response Headers (on 409 Conflict due to closed stream)

When a client attempts to append to a closed stream (without `Stream-Closed: true`), servers **MUST** return:

- `409 Conflict` status code
- `Stream-Closed: true` header
- `Stream-Next-Offset: <offset>`: The final offset of the closed stream (useful for clients to know the stream's final position)

This allows clients to detect and handle the "stream already closed" condition programmatically without parsing the response body. Servers **SHOULD** keep the response body empty or use a standardized error format; clients **SHOULD NOT** rely on parsing the body to determine the reason for rejection.

**Error Precedence:** When an append request would trigger multiple conflict conditions (e.g., stream is closed AND content type mismatches), servers **SHOULD** check the stream's closed status first. This ensures clients receive the `Stream-Closed: true` header, enabling correct error handling. The recommended precedence is:

1. Stream closed → `409 Conflict` with `Stream-Closed: true`
2. Content type mismatch → `409 Conflict`
3. Sequence regression → `409 Conflict`

### 5.2.1. Idempotent Producers

Durable Streams supports Kafka-style idempotent producers for exactly-once write semantics. This enables fire-and-forget writes with server-side deduplication, eliminating duplicates from client retries.

#### Design

- **Client-provided producer IDs**: Zero RTT overhead, no handshake required
- **Client-declared epochs, server-validated fencing**: Client increments epoch on restart; server validates monotonicity and fences stale epochs
- **Per-batch sequence numbers**: Separate from `Stream-Seq`, used for retry safety
- **Two-layer sequence design**:
  - Transport layer: `Producer-Id` + `Producer-Epoch` + `Producer-Seq` (retry safety)
  - Application layer: `Stream-Seq` (cross-restart ordering, lexicographic)

#### Request Headers

All three producer headers **MUST** be provided together or none at all. If only some headers are provided, servers **MUST** return `400 Bad Request`.

- `Producer-Id: <string>`
  - Client-supplied stable identifier (e.g., "order-service-1", UUID)
  - **MUST** be a non-empty string; empty values result in `400 Bad Request`
  - Identifies the logical producer across restarts

- `Producer-Epoch: <integer>`
  - Client-declared epoch, starting at 0
  - Increment on producer restart to establish a new session
  - Server validates that epoch is monotonically non-decreasing
  - **MUST** be a non-negative integer ≤ 2^53-1 (for JavaScript interoperability)

- `Producer-Seq: <integer>`
  - Monotonically increasing sequence number per epoch
  - Starts at 0 for each new epoch
  - Applies per-batch (per HTTP request), not per-message
  - **MUST** be a non-negative integer ≤ 2^53-1 (for JavaScript interoperability)

#### Response Headers

- `Producer-Epoch: <integer>`: Echoed back on success (200/204), or current server epoch on stale epoch (403)
- `Producer-Seq: <integer>`: On success (200/204), the highest accepted sequence number for this `(stream, producerId, epoch)` tuple. Enables clients to confirm pipelined requests and recover state after crashes.
- `Producer-Expected-Seq: <integer>`: On 409 Conflict (sequence gap), the expected sequence
- `Producer-Received-Seq: <integer>`: On 409 Conflict (sequence gap), the received sequence

#### Validation Logic

```
# Epoch validation (client-declared, server-validated)
if epoch < state.epoch:
  → 403 Forbidden
  → Headers: Producer-Epoch: <current epoch>

if epoch > state.epoch:
  if seq != 0:
    → 400 Bad Request (new epoch must start at seq=0)
  → Accept: update state.epoch = epoch, state.lastSeq = 0
  → 200 OK (new epoch established)

# Same epoch: sequence validation
if seq <= state.lastSeq:
  → 204 No Content (duplicate, idempotent success)

if seq == state.lastSeq + 1:
  → Accept, update state.lastSeq = seq
  → 200 OK

if seq > state.lastSeq + 1:
  → 409 Conflict
  → Headers: Producer-Expected-Seq: <lastSeq + 1>, Producer-Received-Seq: <seq>
```

#### Response Codes (with Producer Headers)

- `200 OK`: Append successful (new data)
- `204 No Content`: Duplicate append (idempotent success, data already exists)
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid producer headers (e.g., non-integer values, epoch increase with seq != 0)
- `403 Forbidden`: Stale producer epoch (zombie fencing). Response includes `Producer-Epoch` header with current server epoch.
- `409 Conflict`: Sequence gap detected. Response includes `Producer-Expected-Seq` and `Producer-Received-Seq` headers.

#### Bootstrap and Restart Flow

1. **Initial start (epoch=0)**:
   - Producer sends `(epoch=0, seq=0)`
   - Server accepts, establishes producer state

2. **Producer restart**:
   - Producer increments local epoch (0 → 1), resets seq to 0
   - Sends `(epoch=1, seq=0)`
   - Server sees epoch > state.epoch, accepts, updates state

3. **Zombie fencing**:
   - Old producer (zombie) still sending `(epoch=0, seq=N)` gets 403 Forbidden
   - Response includes `Producer-Epoch: 1` header

#### Auto-claim Flow (for ephemeral producers)

For serverless or ephemeral producers without persisted epoch:

1. Producer starts fresh with `(epoch=0, seq=0)`
2. If server has `state.epoch=5`, returns 403 with `Producer-Epoch: 5`
3. Client can retry with `(epoch=6, seq=0)` to claim the producer ID

This is opt-in client behavior and should be used with caution.

#### Concurrency Requirements

Servers **MUST** serialize validation + append operations per `(stream, producerId)` pair. HTTP requests can arrive out-of-order; without serialization, seq=1 arriving before seq=0 would cause false sequence gaps.

#### Atomicity Requirements

For persistent storage, servers **SHOULD** commit producer state updates and log appends atomically (e.g., in a single database transaction). Non-atomic implementations have a crash window where:

1. Data is appended to the log
2. Crash occurs before producer state is updated
3. On recovery, a retry may be re-accepted, causing duplicate data

**Recovery for non-atomic stores**: Clients can bump their epoch after a crash to establish a clean session. This trades "exactly once within epoch" for "at least once across crashes" which is acceptable for many use cases. Stores **SHOULD** document their atomicity guarantees clearly.

#### Producer State Cleanup

Servers **MAY** implement TTL-based cleanup for producer state:

- **In-memory stores**: 7 days TTL recommended, clean up on stream access
- **Persistent stores**: Retain as long as stream data exists (stronger guarantee)

After state expiry, the producer is treated as new. A zombie alive past TTL expiry can write again, which is acceptable for testing but persistent stores should use longer retention.

#### Stream Closure with Idempotent Producers

Idempotent producers can close streams using the `Stream-Closed: true` header. The behavior is:

- **Close with final append**: Include body, producer headers, and `Stream-Closed: true`. The append is deduplicated normally, and the stream closes atomically with the final append.
- **Close without append**: Include `Stream-Closed: true` with empty body. Producer headers are optional but if provided, the close operation is still idempotent.
- **Duplicate close**: If the stream was already closed by the same `(producerId, epoch, seq)` tuple, servers **SHOULD** return `204 No Content` with `Stream-Closed: true`.

When a closed stream receives an append from an idempotent producer:

- If the `(producerId, epoch, seq)` matches the request that closed the stream, return `204 No Content` (duplicate/idempotent success) with `Stream-Closed: true`
- Otherwise, return `409 Conflict` with `Stream-Closed: true` (stream is closed, no further appends allowed)

### 5.3. Close Stream

To close a stream without appending data, send a POST request with `Stream-Closed: true` and an empty body:

#### Request

```
POST {stream-url}
Stream-Closed: true
```

#### Response Codes

- `204 No Content`: Stream closed successfully (or already closed—idempotent)
- `404 Not Found`: Stream does not exist
- `405 Method Not Allowed` or `501 Not Implemented`: Append/close not supported for this stream

#### Response Headers

- `Stream-Next-Offset: <offset>`: The tail offset (unchanged, since no data was appended)
- `Stream-Closed: true`: Confirms the stream is now closed

This is the canonical "close-only" operation. For atomic "append final message and close", include a request body as described in Section 5.2.

### 5.4. Delete Stream

#### Request

```
DELETE {stream-url}
```

Where `{stream-url}` is the URL of the stream to delete.

Deletes the stream and all its data. In-flight reads may terminate with a `404 Not Found` on subsequent requests after deletion.

#### Response Codes

- `204 No Content`: Stream deleted successfully
- `404 Not Found`: Stream does not exist
- `405 Method Not Allowed` or `501 Not Implemented`: Delete not supported for this stream

**Soft-delete:** When a stream has active forks (reference count > 0), the server **MUST** transition the stream to a soft-deleted state rather than fully removing it. A soft-deleted stream returns `410 Gone` for direct operations, blocks path re-creation via `PUT` (`409 Conflict`), and preserves data for fork readers. When the last fork referencing the stream is deleted, the server cleans up the stream's data via cascading garbage collection (see Section 4.2). This cleanup **MAY** occur asynchronously.

Deleting an already soft-deleted stream **MUST** return `410 Gone`, consistent with all other direct operations on a soft-deleted stream (`GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, `DELETE`).

### 5.5. Stream Metadata

#### Request

```
HEAD {stream-url}
```

Where `{stream-url}` is the URL of the stream. Checks stream existence and returns metadata without transferring a body. This is the canonical way to find the tail offset, TTL, expiry information, and **closure status**.

#### Response Codes

- `200 OK`: Stream exists
- `404 Not Found`: Stream does not exist
- `410 Gone`: Stream is soft-deleted
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded

#### Response Headers (on 200)

- `Content-Type: <stream-content-type>`: The stream's content type
- `Stream-Next-Offset: <offset>`: The tail offset (next offset after the current end)
- `Stream-TTL: <seconds>` (optional): The stream's time-to-live window. Each read or write resets the expiry countdown to this value.
- `Stream-Expires-At: <rfc3339>` (optional): Absolute expiry time, if applicable
- `Stream-Closed: true` (optional): Present when the stream has been closed. Absence indicates the stream is still open.
- `Cache-Control`: See Section 10

#### Caching Guidance

Servers **SHOULD** make `HEAD` responses effectively non-cacheable, for example by returning `Cache-Control: no-store`. Servers **MAY** use `Cache-Control: private, max-age=0, must-revalidate` as an alternative, but `no-store` is recommended to avoid stale tail offsets and closure status.

### 5.6. Read Stream - Catch-up

#### Request

```
GET {stream-url}?offset=<offset>
```

Where `{stream-url}` is the URL of the stream. Returns bytes starting from the specified offset. This is used for catch-up reads when a client needs to replay stream content from a known position.

#### Query Parameters

- `offset` (optional)
  - Start offset token. If omitted, defaults to the stream start (offset -1).

#### Response Codes

- `200 OK`: Data available (or empty body if offset equals tail)
- `400 Bad Request`: Malformed offset or invalid parameters
- `404 Not Found`: Stream does not exist
- `410 Gone`: Offset is before the earliest retained position (retention/compaction), or stream is soft-deleted
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded

For non-live reads without data beyond the requested offset, servers **SHOULD** return `200 OK` with an empty body and `Stream-Next-Offset` equal to the requested offset. If the stream is closed, this response **MUST** also include `Stream-Closed: true` to signal EOF.

#### Response Headers (on 200)

- `Cache-Control`: Derived from TTL/expiry (see Section 9)
- `ETag: {internal_stream_id}:{start_offset}:{end_offset}`
  - Entity tag for cache validation
- `Stream-Cursor: <cursor>` (optional for catch-up, required for live modes)
  - Cursor to echo on subsequent long-poll requests to improve CDN collapsing. Servers **MAY** include this on catch-up reads; it is **required** for live modes when the stream is open (see Sections 5.7, 5.8). Servers **MAY** omit it when `Stream-Closed` is true. Clients **MUST** tolerate its absence when `Stream-Closed` is present.
- `Stream-Next-Offset: <offset>`
  - The next offset to read from (for subsequent requests)
- `Stream-Up-To-Date: true`
  - **MUST** be present and set to `true` when the response includes all data available in the stream at the time the response was generated (i.e., when the requested offset has reached the tail and no more data exists).
  - **SHOULD NOT** be present when returning partial data due to server-defined chunk size limits (when more data exists beyond what was returned).
  - Clients **MAY** use this header to determine when they have caught up and can transition to live tailing mode.
  - **Important:** `Stream-Up-To-Date: true` does **NOT** imply EOF. More data may be appended in the future. Only `Stream-Closed: true` indicates that no more data will ever arrive.
- `Stream-Closed: true`
  - **MUST** be present when the stream is closed **and** the client has reached the final offset **at the time the response is generated**. This includes:
    - Responses that return the final chunk of data, when the stream is already closed at response generation time, or
    - Responses with an empty body when the requested offset equals the tail offset of a closed stream (the canonical EOF signal).
  - When present, clients can conclude that no more data will ever be appended and treat this as EOF.
  - **SHOULD NOT** be present when returning partial data from a closed stream (when more data exists between the response and the final offset). In this case, `Stream-Closed: true` will be returned on a subsequent request that reaches the final offset.
  - **Timing note:** If a stream is closed **after** the final chunk was served (or cached), that chunk will not include `Stream-Closed: true`. Clients discover closure by requesting the next offset (`Stream-Next-Offset` from the previous response), which returns an empty body with `Stream-Closed: true`. This is the expected flow when closure occurs between chunk responses or when serving cached chunks.
  - Clients that need to know closure status before reaching the tail **SHOULD** use `HEAD` (see Section 5.5).

#### Response Body

- Bytes from the stream starting at the specified offset, up to a server-defined maximum chunk size.

### 5.7. Read Stream - Live (Long-poll)

#### Request

```
GET {stream-url}?offset=<offset>&live=long-poll[&cursor=<cursor>]
```

Where `{stream-url}` is the URL of the stream. If no data is available at the specified offset, the server waits up to a timeout for new data to arrive. This enables efficient live tailing without constant polling.

#### Query Parameters

- `offset` (required)
  - The offset to read from. **MUST** be provided.

- `live=long-poll` (required)
  - Indicates long-polling mode.

- `cursor` (optional)
  - Echo of the last `Stream-Cursor` header value from a previous response.
  - Used for collapsing keys in CDN/proxy configurations.

#### Response Codes

- `200 OK`: Data became available within the timeout
- `204 No Content`: Timeout expired with no new data
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid parameters
- `404 Not Found`: Stream does not exist
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded

#### Response Headers (on 200)

- Same as catch-up reads (Section 5.6), plus:
- `Stream-Cursor: <cursor>`: Servers **MUST** include this header. See Section 10.1.

#### Response Headers (on 204)

- `Stream-Next-Offset: <offset>`: Servers **MUST** include a `Stream-Next-Offset` header indicating the current tail offset.
- `Stream-Up-To-Date: true`: Servers **MUST** include this header to indicate the client is caught up with all available data.
- `Stream-Cursor: <cursor>`: Servers **MUST** include this header when the stream is open. Servers **MAY** omit this header when `Stream-Closed` is true (cursor is unnecessary when no further polling is expected). Clients **MUST** tolerate its absence when `Stream-Closed` is present. See Section 10.1.
- `Stream-Closed: true`: **MUST** be present when the stream is closed (see Section 5.6 for semantics). A `204 No Content` with `Stream-Closed: true` indicates EOF.

**EOF Signaling Across Modes:**

Clients should treat **either** of the following as EOF, depending on the mode used:

- **Catch-up mode**: `200 OK` with empty body and `Stream-Closed: true`
- **Long-poll mode**: `204 No Content` with `Stream-Closed: true`
- **SSE mode**: `control` event with `streamClosed: true`

In all cases, `Stream-Closed` / `streamClosed` is the definitive EOF signal. The presence of `Stream-Up-To-Date` / `upToDate` alone does **not** indicate EOF—it only means the client has caught up with currently available data, but more may arrive.

#### Stream Closure Behavior in Long-poll Mode

When the stream is closed and the client is already at the tail offset:

- Servers **MUST NOT** wait for the long-poll timeout
- Servers **MUST** immediately return `204 No Content` with `Stream-Closed: true` and `Stream-Up-To-Date: true`

This ensures clients observing a closed stream do not have hanging connections waiting for data that will never arrive.

#### Response Body (on 200)

- New bytes that arrived during the long-poll period.

#### Timeout Behavior

The timeout for long-polling is implementation-defined. Servers **MAY** accept a `timeout` query parameter (in seconds) as a future extension, but this is not required by the base protocol.

#### Long-poll on forked streams

When long-polling a forked stream:

- **Offset in inherited range** (before the fork offset): Data already exists in the source stream. Servers **MUST** return it immediately without waiting.
- **Offset at the fork's tail**: Servers **MUST** wait only for the fork's own appends. Appends to the source stream after fork creation **MUST NOT** unblock waiters on the fork.

### 5.8. Read Stream - Live (SSE)

#### Request

```
GET {stream-url}?offset=<offset>&live=sse
```

Where `{stream-url}` is the URL of the stream. Returns data as a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream.

SSE mode supports all content types. For streams with `content-type: text/*` or `application/json`, data events carry UTF-8 text directly. For streams with any other `content-type` (binary streams), servers **MUST** automatically base64-encode data events and include the response header `stream-sse-data-encoding: base64`.

SSE responses **MUST** use `Content-Type: text/event-stream` in the HTTP response headers.

When the stream's configured `content-type` is neither `text/*` nor `application/json`, servers **MUST** include the HTTP response header `stream-sse-data-encoding: base64`. Clients **MUST** check for this header and decode data events accordingly.

#### Query Parameters

- `offset` (required)
  - The offset to start reading from.

- `live=sse` (required)
  - Indicates SSE streaming mode.

#### Response Codes

- `200 OK`: Streaming body (SSE format)
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid parameters
- `404 Not Found`: Stream does not exist
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded

#### Response Format

Data is emitted in [Server-Sent Events format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format).

**Events:**

- `data`: Emitted for each batch of data
  - Each line prefixed with `data:`
  - For binary streams (where `stream-sse-data-encoding: base64` is present), the `data` event payload represents bytes encoded using standard base64 per [RFC 4648](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648) (alphabet: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /).
    - Servers **MAY** split the base64 text across multiple `data:` lines within the same SSE `data` event.
    - Clients **MUST** concatenate the `data:` lines for the event (per SSE rules) and **MUST** remove all `\n` and `\r` characters inserted between lines before base64-decoding.
    - The resulting string (after removing `\n` and `\r`) **MUST** be valid base64 text with length that is a multiple of 4 (or empty).
    - If a `data` event's byte payload length is 0, the base64 text **MUST** be the empty string.
  - Base64 encoding affects only `event: data` payloads. `event: control` events remain JSON as specified and are not encoded.
  - When the stream content type is `application/json`, implementations **MAY** batch multiple logical messages into a single SSE `data` event by streaming a JSON array across multiple `data:` lines, as in the example below.
- `control`: Emitted after every data event
  - **MUST** include `streamNextOffset`. See Section 10.1.
  - **MUST** include `streamCursor` when the stream is open. Servers **MAY** omit `streamCursor` when `streamClosed` is true (cursor is unnecessary when no reconnection is expected).
  - **MUST** include `upToDate: true` when the client is caught up with all available data. Note: `streamClosed: true` implies `upToDate: true` (a closed stream at the final offset is by definition up-to-date), so `upToDate` **MAY** be omitted when `streamClosed` is true.
  - **MUST** include `streamClosed: true` when the stream is closed and all data up to the final offset has been sent.
  - Format: JSON object with offset, cursor (when applicable), up-to-date status, and optionally closed status. Field names use camelCase: `streamNextOffset`, `streamCursor`, `upToDate`, and `streamClosed`.

**Example (normal data):**

```
event: data
data: [
data: {"k":"v"},
data: {"k":"w"},
data: ]

event: control
data: {"streamNextOffset":"123456_789","streamCursor":"abc"}
```

**Example (final data with stream closure):**

```
event: data
data: [
data: {"k":"final"}
data: ]

event: control
data: {"streamNextOffset":"123456_999","streamClosed":true}
```

Note: `streamCursor` is omitted when `streamClosed` is true, since clients must not reconnect after receiving a closed signal.

**Client Compatibility:** Clients **MUST** tolerate the absence of `streamCursor` (in SSE) and `Stream-Cursor` (in HTTP headers) when `streamClosed` / `Stream-Closed` is present. Implementations that assume cursor is always present will break when processing closed stream responses.

#### Stream Closure Behavior in SSE Mode

When the stream is closed:

- The final `control` event **MUST** include `streamClosed: true`
- After emitting the final control event, servers **MUST** close the SSE connection
- Clients receiving `streamClosed: true` **MUST NOT** attempt to reconnect, as no more data will arrive

If the stream is already closed when an SSE connection is established and the client's offset is at the tail:

- Servers **MUST** immediately emit a `control` event with `streamClosed: true` and `upToDate: true`
- Servers **MUST** then close the connection

**Example (binary stream with automatic base64 encoding):**

```
event: data
data: AQIDBAUG
data: BwgJCg==

event: control
data: {"streamNextOffset":"123456_789","streamCursor":"abc"}
```

#### Connection Lifecycle

- Server **SHOULD** close connections roughly every ~60 seconds to enable CDN collapsing
- Client **MUST** reconnect using the last received `streamNextOffset` value from the control event
- Client **MUST NOT** reconnect if the last control event included `streamClosed: true`

#### SSE on forked streams

SSE on a forked stream delivers inherited data from the source stream followed by the fork's own data, then waits for new fork appends. Source appends after the fork point are never delivered.

## 6. Reserved Subscription APIs

Subscriptions are durable cursors that wake workers when one or more streams have pending events. Subscription control APIs live under the reserved `__ds` prefix:

```http
{stream-url}/__ds/subscriptions/:id
```

As with stream operations, `{stream-url}` is a placeholder for the implementation's chosen stream URL shape. Servers MUST route the reserved `__ds` prefix before normal stream operations so that subscription control paths are not interpreted as application streams. Application stream paths whose first stream-root-relative segment is `__ds` are reserved for Durable Streams control APIs.

Application streams remain regular durable streams at implementation-defined URLs. Stream paths inside subscription request and response bodies are stream-root-relative paths such as `events/abc` or `wake/pool`.

A subscription can be delivered by webhook or by pull-wake. Both mechanisms share the same cursor fields, generation fencing, lease timeout, and stream membership model.

### 6.1. Subscription Addressing

The subscription `id` is client-provided and unique within the reserved `__ds` metadata namespace.

The server stores one cursor per subscription stream. Each stream link has:

| Field          | Description                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`         | Stream-root-relative stream path                                       |
| `link_type`    | `glob` when matched by `pattern`, `explicit` when added by `streams[]` |
| `acked_offset` | Last processed offset, inclusive                                       |

If a stream is linked both explicitly and by a glob pattern, `explicit` takes precedence in serialized responses. Removing the explicit link does not remove the glob link if the pattern still matches.

### 6.2. Create or Re-confirm a Subscription

```http
PUT {stream-url}/__ds/subscriptions/:id
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "webhook",
  "pattern": "events/*",
  "streams": ["events/manual-a", "events/manual-b"],
  "webhook": { "url": "https://worker.example/hooks" },
  "wake_stream": "wake/pool",
  "filter": {
    "language": "cel",
    "expression": "event.type == 'ready'"
  },
  "lease_ttl_ms": 30000,
  "description": "event processor"
}
```

Fields:

| Field          | Required                | Description                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`         | Yes                     | `webhook` or `pull-wake`                                          |
| `pattern`      | No                      | Glob over stream-root-relative stream paths                       |
| `streams`      | No                      | Explicit stream-root-relative stream paths, additive to `pattern` |
| `webhook.url`  | For `type: "webhook"`   | URL that receives wake notifications                              |
| `wake_stream`  | For `type: "pull-wake"` | Stream-root-relative durable stream path used as the wake channel |
| `filter`       | No                      | Optional wake filter; see Section 7.4.1                           |
| `lease_ttl_ms` | No                      | Lease duration, from 1 second to 10 minutes. Default: 30 seconds  |
| `description`  | No                      | Human-readable description                                        |

At least one of `pattern` or `streams` MUST be present. `pattern` uses these glob rules: `*` matches one path segment and `**` matches zero or more path segments.

Responses:

| Status | Meaning                                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 201    | Subscription created.                                               |
| 200    | Existing subscription re-confirmed with an identical configuration. |
| 409    | Subscription exists with the same ID but a different configuration. |

Servers MUST hash the normalized subscription configuration and compare that hash for idempotent re-confirmation. The hash includes `type`, `pattern`, normalized `streams[]`, delivery configuration, `filter`, `lease_ttl_ms`, and `description`.

Webhook deliveries are signed by the server using an asymmetric webhook signing key. Webhook subscription responses MUST NOT include shared webhook signing secrets. Webhook public key discovery is described in Section 6.5.

Webhook URLs MUST be validated to reduce SSRF risk:

- Production webhook URLs MUST use `https://`.
- Development webhook URLs MAY use `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.x`.
- RFC1918, link-local, loopback, and other local network targets MUST be rejected unless covered by the explicit localhost development exception.

When a subscription with a `pattern` is created, the server MUST eagerly backfill matching existing streams using its internal stream listing facility. Existing streams are linked at their current tail offset so subscription creation does not replay historical data by default. Streams discovered later because of a matching append are linked before that append for wake purposes.

### 6.3. Read or Delete a Subscription

```http
GET {stream-url}/__ds/subscriptions/:id
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "sub-1",
  "subscription_id": "sub-1",
  "type": "webhook",
  "pattern": "events/*",
  "streams": [
    {
      "path": "events/abc",
      "link_type": "glob",
      "acked_offset": "0000000000000001_0000000000000042"
    }
  ],
  "webhook": { "url": "https://worker.example/hooks" },
  "wake_stream": null,
  "filter": {

  "created_at": "2026-05-09T00:00:00.000Z",
  "status": "active",
  "description": "event processor"
}
```

For webhook subscriptions, the `webhook` object MAY include signing metadata:

```json
{
  "webhook": {
    "url": "https://worker.example/hooks",
    "signing": {
      "alg": "ed25519",
      "kid": "ds_abc123",
      "jwks_url": "https://server.example/streams/__ds/jwks.json"
    }
  }
}
```

`jwks_url` is the authoritative URL for the server's webhook signing JWK Set. `kid` is the server's active signing key at serialization time; receivers MUST use the `kid` in each webhook signature header when selecting a verification key.

`status` is `active` while delivery is operating normally and `failed` while webhook retry is scheduled after a failed delivery attempt.

```http
DELETE {stream-url}/__ds/subscriptions/:id
```

Deletion tombstones the subscription and returns `204 No Content`. In-flight callback, ack, or release requests for a deleted subscription MUST fail and MUST NOT advance cursors.

### 6.4. Explicit Stream Membership

Explicit stream links can be added and removed without changing the subscription's glob pattern.

```http
POST {stream-url}/__ds/subscriptions/:id/streams
Content-Type: application/json

{ "streams": ["events/x", "events/y"] }

→ 204 No Content
```

New explicit streams are linked at their current tail offset. Adding an already-linked stream is idempotent.

```http
DELETE {stream-url}/__ds/subscriptions/:id/streams/:path

→ 204 No Content
```

`:path` is the URL-encoded stream-root-relative stream path and may contain slashes. Deleting an absent explicit link is idempotent. This operation removes only the explicit link; a matching glob link remains active.

### 6.5. Webhook Signing Key Discovery

Servers supporting webhook subscriptions MUST expose their webhook signing public keys as a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS):

```http
GET {stream-url}/__ds/jwks.json

→ 200 OK
Content-Type: application/jwk-set+json
Cache-Control: public, max-age=300

{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "OKP",
      "crv": "Ed25519",
      "kid": "ds_abc123",
      "use": "sig",
      "alg": "EdDSA",
      "x": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

This discovery endpoint intentionally lives under the reserved Durable Streams control prefix instead of `/.well-known/`. Durable Streams servers can be embedded under arbitrary sub-roots, and well-known URIs are defined relative to the origin root. Servers MAY expose additional aliases, but webhook receivers SHOULD rely on the `jwks_url` returned in subscription metadata or otherwise derived from the stream root.

Each JWK `kid` MUST be stable for the lifetime of the key and MUST uniquely identify a key within the JWK Set. Servers SHOULD derive `kid` values from key material, for example using a JWK thumbprint. Servers MUST keep private signing keys secret and SHOULD persist them across restarts in production deployments. During key rotation, servers MUST publish old public keys until all webhook deliveries that could have been signed with those keys are outside the accepted replay window.

## 7. Subscription Delivery

A subscription is idle when no lease is held and no wake is in flight. When any linked stream has a tail offset greater than its `acked_offset`, the subscription has pending work. Pending work creates a new wake generation unless the subscription already has a wake in flight or a worker lease is held.

Every wake has a unique `wake_id` and monotonically increasing `generation` scoped to the subscription. Acks are last-processed inclusive: acking offset `N` means the next read for that stream starts after `N`.

### 7.1. Webhook Delivery and Callback

When a matching stream receives an append and the subscription is idle, the Subscription Durable Object sends a webhook request:

```http
POST {webhook.url}
Content-Type: application/json
Webhook-Signature: t=<timestamp>,kid=<key-id>,ed25519=<base64url-signature>

{
  "subscription_id": "sub-1",
  "wake_id": "w_abc123",
  "generation": 7,
  "streams": [
    {
      "path": "events/abc",
      "link_type": "glob",
      "acked_offset": "0000000000000001_0000000000000042",
      "tail_offset": "0000000000000002_0000000000000084",
      "has_pending": true
    }
  ],
  "callback_url": "https://server.example/streams/__ds/subscriptions/sub-1/callback",
  "callback_token": "eyJ..."
}
```

`Webhook-Signature` is an Ed25519 signature over `<timestamp>.<raw_body>`, where `<timestamp>` is the decimal Unix timestamp from the `t` parameter and `<raw_body>` is the exact request body bytes. The `kid` parameter identifies the public key in the server's JWKS, and `ed25519` is the unpadded base64url-encoded signature. Webhook receivers SHOULD verify the signature using the raw request body and reject timestamps outside a small replay window such as five minutes.

The webhook handler can finish synchronously by returning:

```json
{ "done": true }
```

When a webhook returns `{ "done": true }`, the server MUST automatically ack the tail offsets included in that wake snapshot and release the lease. If new events arrived after the snapshot, the subscription still has pending work and MUST be woken again with a new `wake_id` and `generation`.

For asynchronous processing, the handler calls back:

```http
POST {stream-url}/__ds/subscriptions/:id/callback
Authorization: Bearer <callback_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "wake_id": "w_abc123",
  "generation": 7,
  "acks": [{ "stream": "events/abc", "offset": "0000000000000002_0000000000000084" }],
  "done": true
}
```

Callback tokens are scoped to a subscription and generation. They are not service JWTs and are used only for this wake's callback path.

Successful callbacks return:

```json
{ "ok": true, "next_wake": false }
```

If `wake_id` or `generation` is stale, the server MUST return:

```http
409 Conflict
Content-Type: application/json

{ "error": { "code": "FENCED" } }
```

Webhook delivery retries use exponential backoff from 1 second up to 60 seconds with 20% jitter. Retry metadata, including `next_attempt_at`, MUST be persisted across Durable Object eviction so a freshly-loaded object honors the prior retry schedule.

### 7.2. Pull-wake Claim, Ack, and Release

A pull-wake subscription writes wake events to its configured `wake_stream`. The wake stream is an ordinary durable stream and MUST be created explicitly by the application.

Wake event shape:

```json
{
  "type": "wake",
  "subscription_id": "sub-1",
  "stream": "events/abc",
  "generation": 7,
  "ts": 1778324210000
}
```

Workers consume the wake stream and race to claim the subscription:

```http
POST {stream-url}/__ds/subscriptions/:id/claim
Authorization: Bearer <service-jwt>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "worker": "worker-name" }
```

Successful claim:

```json
{
  "wake_id": "w_abc123",
  "generation": 7,
  "token": "eyJ...",
  "streams": [
    {
      "path": "events/abc",
      "link_type": "glob",
      "acked_offset": "0000000000000001_0000000000000042",
      "tail_offset": "0000000000000002_0000000000000084",
      "has_pending": true
    }
  ],
  "lease_ttl_ms": 30000
}
```

If another worker holds the lease:

```http
409 Conflict
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": {
    "code": "ALREADY_CLAIMED",
    "current_holder": "worker-2",
    "generation": 7
  }
}
```

A pull-wake worker acks through the subscription-scoped ack endpoint:

```http
POST {stream-url}/__ds/subscriptions/:id/ack
Authorization: Bearer <claim-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "wake_id": "w_abc123",
  "generation": 7,
  "acks": [{ "stream": "events/abc", "offset": "0000000000000002_0000000000000084" }],
  "done": true
}
```

The ack endpoint doubles as heartbeat. Calling it without `done: true` extends the lease and keeps the worker claim active. Calling it with `done: true` applies the acks, releases the lease, and returns `{ "ok": true, "next_wake": true|false }`.

A worker can voluntarily release without acking:

```http
POST {stream-url}/__ds/subscriptions/:id/release
Authorization: Bearer <claim-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "wake_id": "w_abc123", "generation": 7 }

→ 204 No Content
```

If pending work remains after release, the server MUST write another wake event for a later claim attempt. Stale release or ack requests MUST return `409 FENCED`.

### 7.3. Generation Fencing and Leases

`generation` is the subscription-level fencing counter. It increments for every wake. `wake_id` is unique per wake and prevents a request for one wake from being replayed into another wake in the same generation. Servers MUST reject a callback, ack, or release unless all of the following match current subscription state:

- Bearer token is valid for the subscription.
- Token generation matches the current generation.
- Request `generation` matches the current generation.
- Request `wake_id` matches the current wake.

`lease_ttl_ms` bounds worker liveness. For webhook delivery, the lease starts when a wake is issued and is extended by valid callbacks. For pull-wake, the lease starts when a worker successfully claims and is extended by valid ack calls without `done: true`. When a lease expires, the server MUST clear the holder and wake token; if pending work remains, it MUST schedule another wake.

### 7.4. Coordination Substrate Extensions (Draft)

This section defines draft, product-neutral coordination extensions that sit on
top of streams, producer fencing, and subscriptions. A server MUST NOT advertise
support for a draft extension until the corresponding conformance tests in
`packages/server-conformance-tests` pass. Clients MUST treat these extensions as
optional unless capability discovery or deployment configuration says they are
enabled.

The intent is to keep durable scheduling, predicate wake-up, and commit-once
append behavior in Durable Streams rather than in each workflow or application
runtime that consumes it.

#### 7.4.1. Filtered Subscriptions

Subscriptions MAY include a wake filter. A wake filter controls when a
subscription becomes pending; it does not change the bytes returned by normal
stream reads.

```json
{
  "type": "pull-wake",
  "pattern": "events/*",
  "wake_stream": "wake/pool",
  "filter": {
    "language": "cel",
    "expression": "event.type == 'github.pr.merged' && event.repo == self.repo",
    "self": { "repo": "example/repository" }
  }
}
```

Fields:

| Field               | Required | Description                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `filter.language`   | Yes      | Filter language. The initial portable language is `cel`.         |
| `filter.expression` | Yes      | Boolean expression evaluated per appended event.                 |
| `filter.self`       | No       | Immutable JSON object provided as additional expression context. |

Filters are part of the normalized subscription configuration hash. Reconfirming
a subscription with a different filter MUST return `409 Conflict`.

Filter evaluation context:

| Name     | Description                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `event`  | The decoded JSON stream item being evaluated.               |
| `stream` | Stream-root-relative path of the stream that received data. |
| `offset` | Offset of the evaluated item.                               |
| `self`   | The immutable `filter.self` object, or `{}` if omitted.     |

The initial filter contract applies to streams with `application/json` content.
Servers MUST reject a filtered subscription that targets a stream whose content
type cannot be evaluated, unless the stream does not yet exist. If a future
matching stream has an incompatible content type, the server MUST treat the
append as a non-match and SHOULD expose an operator-visible diagnostic.

Filtered subscriptions keep two cursors internally:

- the public `acked_offset`, advanced only by callback or pull-wake ack; and
- an internal evaluated offset, advanced by the server as it tests events.

Non-matching events MUST NOT wake the subscription, but they MAY advance the
internal evaluated offset so the server does not re-scan the same non-matching
events forever. A matching event after any number of non-matches MUST create the
same wake shape as an unfiltered subscription. The wake snapshot's
`tail_offset` MUST be at least the matching event's offset.

#### 7.4.2. Scheduled Append

Servers MAY expose durable scheduled append under the reserved control prefix:

```http
PUT {stream-url}/__ds/schedules/:id
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "at": "2026-05-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "stream": "sessions/abc",
  "content_type": "application/json",
  "body": { "type": "timer.fired", "timer_id": "t-1" },
  "producer": {
    "id": "timer:t-1",
    "epoch": 0,
    "seq": 0
  }
}
```

Fields:

| Field          | Required | Description                                                                     |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `at`           | Yes      | RFC3339 timestamp. The append MUST NOT occur before this instant.               |
| `stream`       | Yes      | Stream-root-relative target stream path.                                        |
| `content_type` | Yes      | Content type used for the scheduled append.                                     |
| `body`         | Yes      | JSON value to append when `content_type` is `application/json`.                 |
| `body_base64`  | No       | Base64url bytes for non-JSON scheduled appends. Mutually exclusive with `body`. |
| `producer`     | No       | Producer fencing tuple applied to the eventual append.                          |
| `close`        | No       | If `true`, the scheduled append also closes the target stream.                  |

Creating a schedule is idempotent by `:id`. A second `PUT` with the same
normalized schedule MUST return `200 OK`. A second `PUT` with a different
configuration MUST return `409 Conflict`.

The scheduled fire path MUST use the same append implementation as a normal
client append, including content-type checks, stream closure checks, producer
deduplication, `Stream-Seq` validation when applicable, and subscription wake
hooks. If the append is rejected, the schedule MUST transition to `failed` with
the underlying protocol error recorded.

```http
GET {stream-url}/__ds/schedules/:id

→ 200 OK
{
  "id": "t-1",
  "status": "pending",
  "at": "2026-05-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "stream": "sessions/abc"
}
```

Schedule status is one of `pending`, `fired`, `cancelled`, or `failed`.
Schedules MUST survive process restart and Durable Object eviction. Firing MAY
be late, but MUST NOT be early.

```http
DELETE {stream-url}/__ds/schedules/:id

→ 204 No Content
```

Deleting a `pending` schedule cancels it. Deleting a `cancelled` schedule is
idempotent. Deleting a `fired` or `failed` schedule MUST NOT undo the target
stream append.

#### 7.4.3. Commit-once Append

The protocol's producer tuple remains the commit-once primitive. Higher layers
SHOULD model idempotency keys as `(stream, Producer-Id, Producer-Epoch,
Producer-Seq)` instead of adding a second runtime-owned deduplication table.

Coordination extensions that append on behalf of a caller, including scheduled
append, SHOULD accept the same producer tuple and MUST apply the Section 5.2.1
deduplication rules at the final append point. This guarantees that a retry of
a scheduler, webhook receiver, or application ingress can be expressed as the
same durable stream append rather than a runtime-specific "already handled"
side table.

#### 7.4.4. Child and Attachment Composition

No additional protocol is required for child execution or attachment. A child is
a normal stream, the parent appends an invocation fact with a producer tuple,
and the parent registers a subscription or filtered subscription for the child
stream's terminal fact. Progress attachment is the same pattern over non-terminal
child facts.

Implementations MAY provide client helpers for this composition, but those
helpers MUST lower to ordinary stream creation, append, subscription, ack, and
release operations.

## 8. Offsets

Offsets are opaque tokens that identify positions within a stream. They are also used as subscription `acked_offset` cursors (Section 6). They have the following properties:

1. **Opaque**: Clients **MUST NOT** interpret offset structure or meaning
2. **Lexicographically Sortable**: For any two valid offsets for the same stream, a lexicographic comparison determines their relative position in the stream. Clients **MAY** compare offsets lexicographically to determine ordering.
3. **Persistent**: Offsets remain valid for the lifetime of the stream (until deletion or expiration)
4. **Unique**: Each offset identifies exactly one position in the stream. No two positions **MAY** share the same offset.
5. **Strictly Increasing**: Offsets assigned to appended data **MUST** be lexicographically greater than all previously assigned offsets. Server implementations **MUST NOT** use schemes (such as raw UTC timestamps) that can produce duplicate or non-monotonic offsets. Time-based identifiers like ULIDs, which combine timestamps with random components to guarantee uniqueness and monotonicity, are acceptable.

**Format**: Offset tokens are opaque, case-sensitive strings. Their internal structure is implementation-defined. Offsets are single tokens and **MUST NOT** contain `,`, `&`, `=`, `?`, or `/` (to avoid conflict with URL query parameter syntax). Servers **SHOULD** use URL-safe characters to avoid encoding issues, but clients **MUST** properly URL-encode offset values when including them in query parameters. Servers **SHOULD** keep offsets reasonably short (under 256 characters) since they appear in every request URL.

**Sentinel Values**: The protocol defines two special offset sentinel values:

- **`-1` (Stream Beginning)**: The special offset value `-1` represents the beginning of the stream. Clients **MAY** use `offset=-1` as an explicit way to request data from the start. This is semantically equivalent to omitting the offset parameter. Servers **MUST** recognize `-1` as a valid offset that returns data from the beginning of the stream.

- **`now` (Current Tail Position)**: The special offset value `now` allows clients to skip all existing data and begin reading from the current tail position. This is useful for applications that only care about future data (e.g., presence tracking, live monitoring, late joiners to a conversation). The behavior varies by read mode:

  **Catch-up mode** (`offset=now` without `live` parameter):
  - Servers **MUST** return `200 OK` with an empty response body appropriate to the stream's content type:
    - For `application/json` streams: the body **MUST** be `[]` (empty JSON array), consistent with Section 9.1
    - For all other content types: the body **MUST** be 0 bytes (empty)
  - Servers **MUST** include a `Stream-Next-Offset` header set to the current tail position
  - Servers **MUST** include `Stream-Up-To-Date: true` header
  - Servers **SHOULD** return `Cache-Control: no-store` to prevent caching of the tail offset
  - The response **MUST** contain no data messages, regardless of stream content

  **Long-poll mode** (`offset=now&live=long-poll`):
  - Servers **MUST** immediately begin waiting for new data (no initial empty response)
  - This eliminates a round-trip: clients can subscribe to future data in a single request
  - If new data arrives during the wait, servers return `200 OK` with the new data
  - If the timeout expires, servers return `204 No Content` with `Stream-Up-To-Date: true`
  - The `Stream-Next-Offset` header **MUST** be set to the tail position

  **SSE mode** (`offset=now&live=sse`):
  - Servers **MUST** immediately begin the SSE stream from the tail position
  - The first control event **MUST** include the tail offset in `streamNextOffset`
  - If no data has arrived, the first control event **MUST** include `upToDate: true`
  - If data arrives before the first control event, `upToDate` reflects the current state
  - No historical data is sent; only future data events are streamed

  **Closed streams** (`offset=now` on a closed stream):
  - Regardless of the `live` parameter, servers **MUST** return immediately with the closure signal
  - The response **MUST** include `Stream-Closed: true` and `Stream-Up-To-Date: true` headers
  - The `Stream-Next-Offset` header **MUST** be set to the stream's final (tail) offset
  - For catch-up mode: `200 OK` with empty body (or empty JSON array for JSON streams)
  - For long-poll mode: `204 No Content` (no waiting, immediate return)
  - For SSE mode: The first (and only) control event includes `streamClosed: true` and `upToDate: true`, then the connection closes
  - This ensures clients using `offset=now` can immediately discover that a stream has no future data

**Reserved Values**: The sentinel values `-1` and `now` are reserved by the protocol. Server implementations **MUST NOT** generate these strings as actual stream offsets (in `Stream-Next-Offset` headers or SSE control events). This ensures clients can always distinguish between sentinel requests and real offset values.

**Sub-offset addressing**: For operations that accept a `Stream-Fork-Sub-Offset` header (Section 4.2), the sub-offset is a separate addressing dimension alongside the opaque offset. It is not part of the offset value, does not appear in any response, and does not violate the offset opacity, uniqueness, or strict-monotonicity properties above. Servers internally resolve `(offset, suboffset)` to a precise position; all offset values returned to clients remain server-minted opaque tokens conforming to the properties in this section. Future protocol revisions **MAY** extend sub-offset addressing to read operations using the same content-type-driven semantics.

The opaque nature of offsets enables important server-side optimizations. For example, offsets may encode chunk file identifiers, allowing catch-up requests to be served directly from object storage without touching the main database.

Clients **MUST** use the `Stream-Next-Offset` value returned in responses for subsequent read requests. They **SHOULD** persist offsets locally (e.g., in browser local storage or a database) to enable resumability after disconnection or restart.

#### Offsets and forked streams

Forked streams use the same offset space as their source stream — there is no offset translation. The fork offset is the divergence point: data at offsets before it comes from the source, data at or after it comes from the fork. A client reading a forked stream from `-1` sees offsets identical to the source up to the divergence point, then continues with offsets generated by the fork's own appends.

**Fork offset validity:** The `Stream-Fork-Offset` value **MUST** be an offset previously returned by the server (via `Stream-Next-Offset`). As with all offsets, clients **MUST NOT** interpret, construct, or modify offset values (see Section 8, property 1). Servers are **NOT REQUIRED** to validate that a fork offset corresponds to a valid position in the stream's internal storage. If a client provides a client-constructed offset that does not correspond to a valid position, the behavior is undefined — reads on the resulting fork **MAY** return corrupted data or errors. Servers **MAY** validate offset alignment and reject invalid offsets with `400 Bad Request`, but this is not required.

## 9. Content Types

The protocol supports arbitrary MIME content types. Most content types operate at the byte level, leaving message framing and interpretation to clients. The `application/json` content type has special semantics defined below.

**SSE Encoding:**

- SSE mode (Section 5.8) supports all content types. For streams with `content-type: text/*` or `application/json`, data events carry UTF-8 text natively. For all other content types, servers automatically base64-encode data events (see Section 5.8).

Clients **MAY** use any content type for their streams, including:

- `application/json` for JSON mode with message boundary preservation
- `application/ndjson` for newline-delimited JSON
- `application/x-protobuf` for Protocol Buffer messages
- `text/plain` for plain text
- Custom types for application-specific formats

### 9.1. JSON Mode

Streams created with `Content-Type: application/json` have special semantics for message boundaries and batch operations.

#### 9.1.1. Message Boundaries

For `application/json` streams, servers **MUST** preserve message boundaries. Each POST request stores messages as a distinct unit, and GET responses **MUST** return data as a JSON array containing all messages from the requested offset range.

#### 9.1.2. Array Flattening for Batch Operations

When a POST request body contains a JSON array, servers **MUST** flatten exactly one level of the array, treating each element as a separate message. This enables clients to batch multiple messages in a single HTTP request while preserving individual message semantics.

**Examples (direct POST to server):**

- POST body `{"event": "created"}` stores one message: `{"event": "created"}`
- POST body `[{"event": "a"}, {"event": "b"}]` stores two messages: `{"event": "a"}`, `{"event": "b"}`
- POST body `[[1,2], [3,4]]` stores two messages: `[1,2]`, `[3,4]`
- POST body `[[[1,2,3]]]` stores one message: `[[1,2,3]]`

**Note:** Client libraries **MAY** automatically wrap individual values in arrays for batching. For example, a client calling `append({"x": 1})` might send POST body `[{"x": 1}]` to the server, which flattens it to store one message: `{"x": 1}`.

#### 9.1.3. Empty Arrays

Servers **MUST** reject POST requests containing empty JSON arrays (`[]`) with `400 Bad Request`. Empty arrays in append operations represent no-op operations with no semantic meaning and likely indicate a client bug.

PUT requests with an empty array body (`[]`) are valid and create an empty stream. The empty array simply means no initial messages are being written.

#### 9.1.4. JSON Validation

Servers **MUST** validate that appended data is valid JSON. If validation fails, servers **MUST** return `400 Bad Request` with an appropriate error message.

#### 9.1.5. Response Format

GET responses for `application/json` streams **MUST** return `Content-Type: application/json` with a body containing a JSON array of all messages in the requested range:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[{"event":"created"},{"event":"updated"}]
```

If no messages exist in the range, servers **MUST** return an empty JSON array `[]`.

#### JSON mode and forked streams

When a forked stream uses `application/json`, reads spanning the fork boundary (returning both inherited and fork messages) **MUST** wrap all messages in a single JSON array. The fork inherits the source stream's content type if none is specified at creation.

## 10. Caching and Collapsing

### 10.1. Catch-up and Long-poll Reads

For **shared, non-user-specific streams**, servers **SHOULD** return:

```
Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=300
```

For **streams that may contain user-specific or confidential data**, servers **SHOULD** use `private` instead of `public` and rely on CDN configurations that respect `Authorization` or other cache keys:

```
Cache-Control: private, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=300
```

This enables CDN/proxy caching while allowing stale content to be served during revalidation.

**Caching and Stream Closure:**

Catch-up chunks remain fully cacheable, including chunks at the tail of the stream. When a chunk is returned, it may or may not be the final chunk—this is unknown until the client requests the next offset.

The closure signal is discovered when the client requests the offset **after** the final data:

1. Client reads data and receives `Stream-Next-Offset: X` (the tail offset)
2. Client requests offset `X`
3. If stream is closed: server returns `200 OK` with **empty body** and `Stream-Closed: true`
4. If stream is open: server returns `200 OK` with empty body and `Stream-Up-To-Date: true` (or long-poll/SSE waits for data)

This design ensures:

- All data chunks are cacheable (a chunk that later becomes "final" was still valid data)
- The closure signal is a distinct request/response at the tail offset
- Cached chunks never become "stale" due to closure—clients simply make one more request to discover EOF

**ETag Usage:**

Servers **MUST** generate `ETag` headers for GET responses, except for `offset=now` responses. Clients **MAY** use `If-None-Match` with the `ETag` value on repeat catch-up requests. When a client provides a valid `If-None-Match` header that matches the current ETag, servers **MUST** respond with `304 Not Modified` (with no body) instead of re-sending the same data. This is essential for fast loading and efficient bandwidth usage.

**ETag and Stream Closure:** ETags **MUST** vary with the stream's closure status. When a stream is closed (without new data being appended), the ETag **MUST** change to ensure clients do not receive `304 Not Modified` responses that would hide the closure signal. Implementations **SHOULD** include a closure indicator in the ETag format (e.g., appending `:c` to the ETag when the stream is closed).

**Query Parameter Ordering:**

For optimal cache behavior, clients **SHOULD** order query parameters lexicographically by key name. This ensures consistent URL serialization across implementations and improves CDN cache hit rates.

**Collapsing:**

Clients **SHOULD** echo the `Stream-Cursor` value as `cursor=<cursor>` in subsequent long-poll requests. This, along with the appropriate `Cache-Control` header, enables CDNs and proxies to collapse multiple clients waiting for the same data into a single upstream request.

**Server-Generated Cursors:**

To prevent infinite CDN cache loops (where clients receive the same cached empty response indefinitely), servers **MUST** generate cursors on all live mode responses:

- **Long-poll**: `Stream-Cursor` response header
- **SSE**: `streamCursor` field in `control` events

The cursor mechanism works as follows:

1. **Interval-based Calculation**: Servers divide time into fixed intervals (default: 20 seconds) counted from an epoch (default: October 9, 2024 00:00:00 UTC). The cursor value is the interval number as a decimal string.

2. **Cursor Generation**: For each live response, the server calculates the current interval number and returns it as the cursor value.

3. **Monotonic Progression**: Servers **MUST** ensure cursors never go backwards. When a client provides a `cursor` query parameter that is greater than or equal to the current interval number, the server **MUST** return a cursor strictly greater than the client's cursor (by adding random jitter of 1-3600 seconds). This guarantees monotonic progression and prevents cache cycles.

4. **Client Behavior**: Clients **MUST** include the received cursor value as the `cursor` query parameter in subsequent requests. This creates different cache keys as time progresses, ensuring CDN caches eventually expire.

**Example Cursor Flow:**

```
# Client makes initial long-poll request
GET /stream?offset=123&live=long-poll

# Server returns cursor based on current interval (e.g., interval 1000)
< Stream-Cursor: 1000

# Client echoes cursor on next request
GET /stream?offset=123&live=long-poll&cursor=1000

# If still in same interval, server adds jitter and returns advanced cursor
< Stream-Cursor: 1050
```

**Long-poll Caching:**

CDNs and proxies **SHOULD NOT** cache `204 No Content` responses from long-poll requests in most cases. Long-poll `200 OK` responses are safe to cache when keyed by `offset`, `cursor`, and authentication credentials.

### 10.2. SSE

SSE connections **SHOULD** be closed by the server approximately every 60 seconds. This enables new clients to collapse onto edge requests rather than maintaining long-lived connections to origin servers.

## 11. Extensibility

The Durable Streams Protocol is designed to be extended for specific use cases and implementations. Extensions **SHOULD** be pure supersets of the base protocol, ensuring compatibility with any client that implements the base protocol.

### 11.1. Protocol Extensions

Implementations **MAY** extend the protocol with additional query parameters, headers, or response fields to support domain-specific semantics. For example, a database synchronization implementation might add query parameters to filter by table or schema, or include additional metadata in response headers.

Extensions **SHOULD** follow these principles:

- **Backward Compatibility**: Extensions **MUST NOT** break base protocol semantics. Clients that do not understand extension parameters or headers **MUST** be able to operate using only base protocol features.

- **Pure Superset**: Extensions **SHOULD** be additive only. New parameters and headers **SHOULD** be optional, and servers **SHOULD** provide sensible defaults or fallback behavior when extensions are not used.

- **Version Independence**: Extensions **SHOULD** work with any version of a client that implements the base protocol. Extension negotiation **MAY** be handled through headers or query parameters, but base protocol operations **MUST** remain functional without extension support.

### 11.2. Authentication Extensions

See Section 12.1 for authentication and authorization details. Implementations **MAY** extend the protocol with authentication-related query parameters or headers (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens, custom authentication headers).

## 12. Security Considerations

### 12.1. Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization are explicitly out of scope for this protocol specification. Clients **SHOULD** implement all standard HTTP authentication primitives (e.g., Basic Authentication [RFC7617], Bearer tokens [RFC6750], Digest Authentication [RFC7616]). Implementations **MUST** provide appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized stream creation, modification, or deletion, but may do so using any mechanism they choose, including extending the protocol with authentication-related parameters or headers as described in Section 11.2.

### 12.2. Multi-tenant Safety

If stream URLs are guessable, servers **MUST** enforce access controls even when using shared caches. Servers **SHOULD** validate and sanitize stream URLs to prevent path traversal attacks and ensure URL components are within acceptable limits.

### 12.3. Untrusted Content

Clients **MUST** treat stream contents as untrusted input and **MUST NOT** evaluate or execute stream data without appropriate validation. This is particularly important for append-only streams used as logs, where log injection attacks are a concern.

### 12.4. Content Type Validation

Servers **MUST** validate that appended content types match the stream's declared content type to prevent type confusion attacks.

### 12.5. Rate Limiting

Servers **SHOULD** implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. The `429 Too Many Requests` response code indicates rate limit exhaustion.

### 12.6. Sequence Validation

The optional `Stream-Seq` header provides protection against out-of-order writes in multi-writer scenarios. Servers **MUST** reject sequence regressions to maintain stream integrity.

### 12.7. Browser Security Headers

When serving streams to browser clients, servers **SHOULD** include the following headers to prevent MIME-sniffing attacks, cross-origin embedding exploits, and cache-related vulnerabilities:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - Servers **SHOULD** include this header on all responses. This prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing the response content and potentially executing it as a different content type (e.g., interpreting binary data as HTML/JavaScript).

- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` (or `same-origin`/`same-site`)
  - Servers **SHOULD** include this header to explicitly control cross-origin embedding. Use `cross-origin` to allow cross-origin access via `fetch()`, `same-site` to restrict to the same registrable domain, or `same-origin` for strict same-origin only. This prevents Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB) issues and protects against Spectre-like side-channel attacks.

- `Cache-Control: no-store`
  - Servers **SHOULD** include this header on HEAD responses and on responses containing sensitive or user-specific stream data. This prevents intermediate proxies and CDNs from caching potentially sensitive content. For public, non-sensitive historical reads, servers **MAY** use `Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=300` as described in Section 10.

- `Content-Disposition: attachment` (optional)
  - Servers **MAY** include this header for `application/octet-stream` responses to prevent inline rendering if a user navigates directly to the stream URL.

These headers provide defense-in-depth for scenarios where stream URLs might be accessed outside the intended programmatic fetch context (e.g., direct navigation, malicious cross-origin embedding via `<script>` or `<img>` tags).

### 12.8. Webhook URL Validation (SSRF Prevention)

Implementations supporting webhook subscriptions **MUST** validate webhook URLs to prevent Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks:

- **MUST** require HTTPS for webhook URLs in production (HTTP **MAY** be allowed for localhost in development)
- **SHOULD** block private IP ranges (RFC 1918), link-local addresses, and loopback addresses
- **SHOULD** block cloud metadata endpoints (e.g., `169.254.169.254`)
- **MAY** implement domain allowlisting for webhook URLs

### 12.9. Callback Token Security

Callback and claim tokens **MUST** be passed via the `Authorization` header to avoid logging exposure. Tokens **SHOULD** be signed (e.g., HMAC-signed JWTs) containing the subscription identity, generation, and expiry. Implementations **MUST** validate token signatures on every callback, ack, and release request.

### 12.10. Webhook Signature Security

Webhook signatures (Section 7.1) prevent spoofing of notifications. Webhook receivers **SHOULD** verify signatures before processing any webhook payload, select verification keys by `kid` from the server's JWKS, and reject timestamps outside the accepted replay window. Receivers that share a webhook endpoint across multiple Durable Streams servers or subscriptions **SHOULD** also check the expected server key set and `subscription_id` before doing work.

### 12.11. TLS

All protocol operations **MUST** be performed over HTTPS (TLS) in production environments to protect data in transit.

## 13. IANA Considerations

### 13.1. Default Port

The default port for standalone Durable Streams servers is **4437/tcp** (with 4437/udp reserved for future use).

This port was selected from the IANA unassigned range 4434-4440. Standalone server implementations **SHOULD** use port 4437 as the default when no explicit port is configured. When Durable Streams is integrated into an existing web server or application framework, it **SHOULD** use the host server's port instead.

### 13.2. HTTP Headers

This document requests registration of the following HTTP headers in the "Permanent Message Header Field Names" registry:
