# Client Library Maturity Model

Durable Streams clients follow a maturity progression that helps users understand the readiness of each implementation and guides contributors on how to help. For an overview of all client libraries and their current maturity levels, see the [Client Libraries](docs/clients.md) documentation.

## Maturity Levels

### Level 1: Vibe-Engineered

Initial implementation, typically AI-assisted or created rapidly to prove out the API surface.

**Criteria:**

- Implements core protocol operations (create, append, read, delete, head)
- Passes the client conformance test suite
- Has basic documentation (README with installation and usage examples)
- Published to the language's package registry

**What this means for users:**

- API may change based on ecosystem feedback
- Suitable for prototyping and non-critical workloads
- May have rough edges or non-idiomatic patterns
- Community feedback actively sought

**How to level up:**

- Get a language/ecosystem expert to review the implementation
- Incorporate idiomatic patterns and best practices
- Address any API ergonomics issues

---

### Level 2: Expert-Reviewed

A language or ecosystem expert has reviewed and improved the implementation.

**Criteria:**

- All Level 1 criteria, plus:
- Reviewed by someone with significant experience in the language ecosystem
- API follows language-specific idioms and conventions
- Error handling follows ecosystem best practices
- Documentation includes idiomatic examples
- Performance characteristics are reasonable for the ecosystem

**What this means for users:**

- API is stable and idiomatic
- Suitable for production use with appropriate testing
- Implementation quality is on par with other ecosystem libraries
- Maintainers understand the language deeply enough to handle issues

**How to level up:**

- Get adoption from real-world users
- Address issues and feedback from production usage
- Build a track record of stability

---

### Level 3: Production-Proven

Widespread usage in production environments with a track record of stability.

**Criteria:**

- All Level 2 criteria, plus:
- Used in production by multiple organizations
- Has survived real-world edge cases and failure modes
- Stable API with semantic versioning
- Responsive maintenance (issues addressed, security patches)
- May have framework integrations (e.g., Express middleware, Django adapter)

**What this means for users:**

- Battle-tested implementation
- Confident choice for critical workloads
- Active community and maintenance
- Long-term support expectations

| Client         | Level                 | Package                                                                                       | Conformance | Notes                                                            |
| -------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TypeScript** | 3 - Production-Proven | [@durable-streams/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@durable-streams/client)              | 110/110     | Reference implementation. 1.5+ years production use at Electric. |
| **Python**     | 2 - Expert-Reviewed   | [durable-streams](https://pypi.org/project/durable-streams/)                                  | 110/110     | Async and sync APIs. Reviewed for Pythonic patterns.             |
| **Go**         | 2 - Expert-Reviewed   | [client-go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/durable-streams/durable-streams/packages/client-go) | 110/110     | Google Cloud style API. Zero external dependencies.              |
| **Java**       | 1 - Vibe-Engineered   | [durable-streams-java](https://github.com/Clickin/durable-streams-java)                       | TBD         | Community contribution. Framework adapters included.             |

### Planned Clients

Based on analysis of client library adoption across Kafka, Redis Streams, NATS, Pulsar, and Kinesis ecosystems:

| Language    | Priority | Rationale                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rust**    | High     | Systems programming crowd, signals "serious infrastructure." NATS has official support, growing Kafka community. |
| **C#/.NET** | High     | ~29% professional usage, every major streaming platform has official support. Microsoft/Azure ecosystem.         |
| **Ruby**    | Medium   | ~5% web apps, strong in DevOps/infrastructure tooling. Good for ops scripts consuming streams.                   |
| **PHP**     | Medium   | Powers 75%+ of server-side web. Large surface area for webhook-to-stream and legacy integration.                 |
| **Elixir**  | Medium   | NATS has official support. Strong fit for real-time/concurrent systems (Erlang/OTP).                             |
| **Swift**   | Lower    | iOS/macOS native. Mobile-first sync scenarios.                                                                   |
| **Kotlin**  | Lower    | Interops with Java, but separate client could provide better ergonomics.                                         |

## How to Contribute

### Creating a New Client

1. **Study the protocol**: Read [PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md) thoroughly
2. **Reference existing clients**: The TypeScript client is the canonical reference
3. **Use conformance tests**: Run `pnpm test:run -- --client <language>` against your implementation
4. **Follow ecosystem conventions**: Look at how other streaming libraries (Kafka, NATS, Redis) structure their clients in your language

### Leveling Up an Existing Client

#### From Level 1 to Level 2:

If you're an expert in a language where we have a Level 1 client:

1. **Review the API**: Does it feel natural for the ecosystem? Compare to popular libraries.
2. **Check error handling**: Does it follow language conventions? (e.g., Go's `error` returns, Python's exceptions, Rust's `Result`)
3. **Review documentation**: Are examples idiomatic? Would a newcomer understand them?
4. **Performance audit**: Any obvious inefficiencies? Unnecessary allocations?
5. **Open a PR**: Document what you reviewed and any changes made

#### From Level 2 to Level 3:

This happens organically through adoption, but you can help by:

1. **Using the client**: Real-world usage finds edge cases
2. **Reporting issues**: Even small papercuts help improve quality
3. **Contributing fixes**: Bug fixes and improvements are always welcome
4. **Sharing your experience**: Blog posts, talks, or case studies help others adopt

## Expert Review Checklist

When reviewing a client for Level 2 certification:

### API Design

- [ ] Method names follow language conventions (e.g., `snake_case` for Python, `camelCase` for Java)
- [ ] Error handling is idiomatic (exceptions vs. error returns vs. Result types)
- [ ] Resource cleanup follows patterns (context managers, defer, RAII, etc.)
- [ ] Async patterns are correct for the ecosystem
- [ ] Configuration follows ecosystem norms (builders, options, config structs)

### Documentation

- [ ] README shows installation for common package managers
- [ ] Quick start example is copy-pasteable
- [ ] API documentation is complete
- [ ] Examples follow ecosystem conventions

### Implementation Quality

- [ ] No obvious performance issues
- [ ] Reasonable memory usage
- [ ] Proper HTTP connection handling
- [ ] Timeout and cancellation support
- [ ] Thread/concurrency safety documented

### Testing

- [ ] Passes conformance test suite
- [ ] Unit tests for language-specific code paths
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Versioning and Stability

All clients follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Level 1 clients**: May have breaking changes in minor versions (0.x.y)
- **Level 2+ clients**: Follow semver strictly after 1.0.0

We recommend Level 1 clients pin exact versions and Level 2+ clients use compatible version ranges.
