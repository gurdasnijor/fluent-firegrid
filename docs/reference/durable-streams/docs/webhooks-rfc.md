## Summary

Serverless functions and AI agents need to react to events without holding persistent connections, but Durable Streams currently only supports pull-based consumption. This RFC adds webhook-based push delivery: register a subscription with a glob pattern and webhook URL, and the server will POST notifications when matching streams receive events. Each matched stream spawns a consumer instance that can dynamically subscribe to additional streams (e.g., an agent subscribing to its task queue plus shared filesystem and tool outputs), with the server tracking offsets across all subscribed streams as a unit. Consumers read events using the standard Durable Streams client, use a scoped callback URL to acknowledge progress and manage subscriptions, and signal completion when done—or get re-woken when new events arrive. The implementation adds subscription CRUD endpoints, consumer instance lifecycle management, exponential backoff retry for failed webhooks, and OpenTelemetry integration for debugging.

## Background

Modern event-driven architectures increasingly run on serverless functions (Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda, etc.) where compute spins up only when there's work to do. This pattern is particularly common for AI agent systems, where each agent instance handles a specific task and may need to coordinate across multiple event streams—its own task queue, shared resources, tool outputs.

Durable Streams currently requires consumers to actively poll or maintain persistent connections (long-poll, SSE) to receive events. This works for always-on services but creates friction for serverless deployments:

- Functions can't hold open connections waiting for events
- Polling from cold functions is wasteful and adds latency
- Coordinating reads across multiple related streams requires complex client logic

A push-based delivery model—where the server notifies consumers when events arrive—would let serverless functions wake on demand, process events, and shut down cleanly.

### Related Systems

This design draws from several comparable systems:

- **Apache Kafka** — Consumer group protocol with session timeouts, consumer epochs for fencing zombie consumers, and KIP-848 server-side assignment
- **NATS JetStream** — Push consumers with ack-wait timeouts, max_ack_pending flow control, and delivery policies
- **Restate** — Virtual Objects with single-writer semantics and keyed state management
- **Inngest** — Serverless function orchestration with step-based execution and event-driven invocation
- **Svix/Hookdeck** — Webhook delivery infrastructure with signature verification, retry schedules, and dead letter queues

## Problem

Serverless functions cannot efficiently consume Durable Streams today. The current pull-based model requires either:

1. **Persistent connections** (long-poll/SSE) — incompatible with serverless execution limits
2. **Periodic polling** — wasteful, adds latency, and doesn't scale when an agent needs to monitor multiple streams

This gap blocks a key use case: **multi-agent systems** where each agent instance needs to:

- React to events on its primary task stream
- Dynamically subscribe to additional streams (shared filesystem, tool outputs, coordination channels)
- Maintain offsets across all subscribed streams as a unit
- Resume exactly where it left off after being idle

Without server-side push, building this requires external orchestration (separate queue systems, workflow engines) that duplicates what Durable Streams already provides—durable, resumable, ordered event delivery.

**Constraints:**

- Must work with serverless functions that have 30-second to 5-minute execution limits
- Must handle webhook endpoint failures gracefully (deploys, outages, bugs)
- Protocol must support distributed deployments, even if reference implementations are single-server
- No authentication built-in (handled at deployment layer, consistent with existing protocol)

## Proposal

### Overview

Add a webhook-based push delivery system to Durable Streams. The core concepts:

- **Subscription**: A registration that maps a glob pattern to a webhook URL. When streams matching the pattern receive events, the server notifies the webhook.
- **Consumer Instance**: Spawned when a stream matches a subscription's pattern. Each instance has its own identity, epoch (for fencing), offsets, and can dynamically subscribe to additional streams.
- **Callback**: A scoped URL that consumer instances use to acknowledge progress, subscribe to additional streams, and signal completion.

### Subscription Model

A subscription is registered via HTTP API and consists of:

- `subscription_id`: Client-provided identifier for this subscription
- `pattern`: Glob pattern matching stream paths (e.g., `/agents/*`)
- `webhook`: URL to POST notifications to
- `webhook_secret`: Server-generated secret for signature verification (returned on creation, not stored retrievably)
- `description`: Optional human-readable description
- `internal`: Optional boolean flag indicating this is an internal subscription (for secondary stream coordination)

When a stream is created or receives events that match the pattern, the server spawns a consumer instance (if one doesn't exist) and wakes it.

Subscriptions marked as `internal: true` may be routed differently by implementations (e.g., direct function calls instead of HTTP in single-server deployments), but the behavior is identical.

**Glob patterns** support wildcards:

- `*` matches exactly one path segment
- `**` matches zero or more path segments (recursive)
- `/agents/*` matches `/agents/task-123` but not `/agents/foo/bar`
- `/agents/**` matches `/agents/task-123` and `/agents/foo/bar/baz`
- `/agents/*/inbox` matches `/agents/worker-1/inbox`

```

**Pending work definition:**

Pending work exists when any subscribed stream has unprocessed events:

```
pending_work = any(tail[path] > acked[path] for path in subscribed_streams)
```

Where:

- `acked[path]` is the last acknowledged offset (inclusive - this event was processed)
- `tail[path]` is the current end offset of the stream
- Offset `-1` means "before any events" (nothing acked yet)

This definition drives wake decisions, re-wake after timeouts, and whether `{done: true}` transitions to IDLE.

**State transitions:**

1. **IDLE → WAKING**: `pending_work` becomes true; epoch is incremented, new `wake_id` generated
2. **WAKING → LIVE**: Webhook responds 2xx, OR first callback claims the `wake_id` (subsequent callbacks with same wake_id are idempotent; callbacks with a non-matching wake_id receive `409 ALREADY_CLAIMED`)
3. **WAKING → IDLE**: Consumer responds with `{ done: true }` AND `pending_work` is false
4. **LIVE → IDLE**: Consumer sends `{ done: true }` in callback AND `pending_work` is false, OR 45-second timeout with no callback activity
5. **Re-wake**: If `{done: true}` is received but `pending_work` is still true, immediately trigger a new wake (increment epoch, new wake_id)

**Epoch and wake_id for fencing:** Two identifiers work together to prevent split-brain scenarios:

- **`epoch`**: Monotonically increasing counter that increments on each IDLE → WAKING transition. Callbacks with a stale epoch are rejected with `409 STALE_EPOCH`. This is analogous to producer epochs in the existing Durable Streams protocol.
- **`wake_id`**: Unique identifier for each wake attempt within an epoch. The first callback claiming a `wake_id` wins; subsequent callbacks with the same `wake_id` receive `409 ALREADY_CLAIMED`. This handles duplicate webhook deliveries (retries before claim).

**Wake transition:** A 2xx webhook response means the consumer has received the notification and is actively processing — the server transitions immediately to LIVE. The 45-second liveness timeout covers crash recovery from that point. This design supports serverless functions that hold the webhook connection open during processing. If the webhook fails (non-2xx, timeout, network error), the server retries with exponential backoff until a callback claims the `wake_id` or the webhook succeeds.

**Webhook connection model:** The webhook connection can be held open for the platform's execution limit (e.g., 15 minutes on some serverless platforms). The server tracks consumer liveness via callback activity, not the webhook connection. Consumers should call the callback regularly (at least every 45 seconds) to stay alive. If the webhook connection closes without `{ done: true }` and no recent callback activity, the server treats this as a crash and will re-wake if there's pending work.

**Timeout (45 seconds):** Any callback request (including empty `{}`) resets the timeout. If no callback activity occurs within 45 seconds, the consumer transitions to IDLE. Consumers doing slow processing should send periodic callbacks (even just re-acking the same offset) to stay alive.

**Consumer instance identity** is `{subscription_id}:{url_encoded_stream_path}`. The stream path is URL-encoded to avoid parsing ambiguity (paths contain `/`). Multiple subscriptions can match the same stream, each creating independent consumer instances.

### Wake-up Notification

When waking a consumer, the server POSTs to the webhook:

```http
POST https://my-agent.workers.dev/handler
Content-Type: application/json
Webhook-Signature: t=1704067200,sha256=a1b2c3d4e5f6...

{
  "consumerId": "sub_a1b2c3d4:%2Fagents%2Ftask-123",
  "epoch": 7,
  "wakeId": "w_f8a3b2c1",
  "streamPath": "/agents/task-123",
  "streams": [
    { "path": "/agents/task-123", "offset": "1002" },
    { "path": "/shared-filesystem/task-123", "offset": "500" }
  ],
  "triggeredBy": ["/agents/task-123", "/shared-filesystem/task-123"],
  "callback": "https://streams.example.com/callback/sub_a1b2c3d4/%2Fagents%2Ftask-123",
  "claimToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
}
```

**Headers:**

- `Webhook-Signature`: Signature for verification (see Webhook Signature Verification below)

**Payload fields:**

- `consumerId`: Unique identifier for this consumer instance
- `epoch`: Current epoch; consumers must include this in callback requests for fencing
- `wakeId`: Unique identifier for this wake attempt; consumers must include this in their first callback to claim the wake
- `streamPath`: Canonical main stream path for the wake
- `streams`: All streams this consumer is subscribed to, with their last acknowledged offset
- `triggeredBy`: Array of stream paths that have pending events (informational—consumer should read from all streams based on their offsets, not just triggered ones)
- `callback`: Scoped URL for acknowledgments and subscription changes
- `claimToken`: Initial callback credential; use in `Authorization: Bearer` header for first callback

The webhook can respond with `{ "done": true }` to immediately return to IDLE (for simple synchronous processing). This counts as claiming the wake—the server will not redeliver.

**Wake-up batching:** If multiple events arrive on subscribed streams while the consumer is IDLE, they are batched into a single wake-up. The server does not wake the consumer multiple times—one wake-up per IDLE → WAKING transition.

**No re-wake while LIVE:** If the consumer is already LIVE (actively processing), new events on subscribed streams do not trigger additional wake-ups. The consumer reads new events through its existing client connections.

### Webhook Signature Verification

All webhook notifications are signed to prevent spoofing. Consumers should verify signatures before processing.

**Signature format:**

```
Webhook-Signature: t=<timestamp>,sha256=<signature>
```

- `t`: Unix timestamp (seconds) when the signature was generated
- `sha256`: HMAC-SHA256 of `<timestamp>.<body>` using the subscription's `webhook_secret`

**Verification steps:**

1. Extract timestamp and signature from header
2. Check timestamp is within acceptable window (e.g., ±5 minutes) to prevent replay attacks
3. Compute expected signature: `HMAC-SHA256(webhook_secret, "<timestamp>.<raw_body>")`
4. Compare signatures using constant-time comparison

**Important:** Use the raw request body bytes (UTF-8, as received) for signature verification. Do not parse and re-stringify JSON—this can change whitespace or key order and break the signature.

**Example verification:**

```typescript
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from "crypto"

function verifyWebhookSignature(
  body: string,
  signatureHeader: string,
  secret: string,
  toleranceSeconds = 300
): boolean {
  const match = signatureHeader.match(/t=(\d+),sha256=([a-f0-9]+)/)
  if (!match) return false

  const [, timestamp, signature] = match
  const ts = parseInt(timestamp, 10)

  // Check timestamp is within tolerance
  const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)
  if (Math.abs(now - ts) > toleranceSeconds) return false

  // Compute expected signature
  const payload = `${timestamp}.${body}`
  const expected = createHmac("sha256", secret).update(payload).digest("hex")

  // Constant-time comparison
  return timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(signature), Buffer.from(expected))
}
```

### Event Reading

The webhook notification tells the consumer _what_ to read, not the events themselves. Consumers read events using **standard Durable Streams HTTP reads** via the client library.

This separation keeps the webhook system focused on coordination while leveraging the existing protocol for data transfer. Authentication for reading streams is handled at the deployment layer, same as existing reads.

### Callback API

The callback URL is scoped to the specific consumer instance. The claim token is passed via the `Authorization` header to avoid logging exposure; it handles authentication and expiry (1 hour TTL) only. Fencing is handled by `epoch` and `wakeId`.

```http
POST {callback}
Authorization: Bearer eyJ...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "epoch": 7,
  "wakeId": "w_f8a3b2c1",
  "acks": [
    { "path": "/agents/task-123", "offset": "1005" },
    { "path": "/shared-filesystem/task-123", "offset": "520" }
  ],
  "subscribe": ["/tools/task-123"],
  "unsubscribe": ["/some-old-stream"],
  "done": true
}
```

**Required fields:**

- `epoch`: Must match current consumer epoch (fencing)
- `wakeId`: Must be included in first callback to claim the wake; optional in subsequent callbacks

**Optional fields:**

- `acks`, `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `done`: All optional

**Callback semantics:**

- Callbacks are processed **serially** per consumer instance (no concurrent processing)
- All operations are **idempotent**—safe to retry on timeout
- Requests are **atomic**—entire request succeeds or fails together
- Any callback (even empty `{}`) resets the 45-second timeout

**Success response:**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "claimToken": "eyJ...",
  "streams": [
    { "path": "/agents/task-123", "offset": "1005" },
    { "path": "/shared-filesystem/task-123", "offset": "520" },
    { "path": "/tools/task-123", "offset": "42" }
  ]
}
```

- `claimToken`: New callback credential (always included; consumer should use this for subsequent requests)
- `streams`: Current list of all subscribed streams with their offsets (always included)

**Error responses:**

| Status | Code              | Description                                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400    | `INVALID_REQUEST` | Malformed JSON, unknown fields                                              |
| 401    | `TOKEN_EXPIRED`   | Callback token has expired (response includes new token)                    |
| 401    | `TOKEN_INVALID`   | Callback token is malformed or signature invalid                            |
| 409    | `ALREADY_CLAIMED` | This `wake_id` was already claimed by another callback (duplicate delivery) |
| 409    | `INVALID_OFFSET`  | Ack offset is invalid (e.g., beyond stream tail)                            |
| 409    | `STALE_EPOCH`     | Callback epoch is older than current consumer epoch (zombie consumer)       |
| 410    | `CONSUMER_GONE`   | Consumer instance no longer exists (subscription deleted)                   |

Error response body:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "STALE_EPOCH",
    "message": "Consumer epoch 5 is stale; current epoch is 7"
  },
  "claimToken": "eyJ..."
}
```

For `TOKEN_EXPIRED`, a new claim token is included in the error response—consumer should retry with the new token.

For `STALE_EPOCH`, the consumer should stop processing—a newer instance has taken over.

For `ALREADY_CLAIMED`, another callback already claimed this wake—the consumer should stop processing (this typically happens with duplicate webhook deliveries due to retries).

**Offset semantics:**

Offsets are **"last processed inclusive"**—the offset value represents the last event that was successfully processed. This means:

- Offset `"1005"` means events up to and including 1005 have been processed
- Next read should start from offset `"1006"`
- Offset `"-1"` means no events have been processed yet (start from beginning)

**Subscribe behavior:**

- New subscriptions start at current tail (new events only)
- Subscribing to a non-existent stream is allowed—consumer will be woken when the stream is created and receives its first event (useful for tool output streams that appear during execution)
- No validation of stream paths; typos won't be caught until the stream fails to appear

**Unsubscribe behavior:**

- Consumer can unsubscribe from any stream including its primary
- Unsubscribing from primary is valid—any remaining subscribed stream can still wake the consumer
- Unsubscribing from all streams removes the consumer instance

**Stream removal:** If a subscribed stream is deleted, it is silently removed from the consumer's subscription list. The next callback response will show the updated `streams` array without the deleted stream.

### Secondary Subscriptions (Internal Webhooks)

When a consumer subscribes to streams beyond its primary, the coordination works via internal webhooks:

1. Primary stream's server creates a subscription on the secondary stream (marked as `internal: true`)
2. Secondary stream sends webhook notifications to the primary stream's server (not directly to the consumer)
3. Primary stream decides whether to wake the consumer (if IDLE) or let the callback loop handle it (if LIVE)

This model:

- Uses the same webhook mechanism everywhere (including HMAC signature verification for internal webhooks)
- Works naturally in distributed deployments where streams live on different servers
- Keeps the primary stream as single source of truth for consumer state

For single-server deployments, implementations may optimize internal subscriptions (e.g., direct function calls). For distributed deployments, it's HTTP between servers with the same signature verification. The routing optimization is implementation-specific.

### Failure Handling

**Webhook request timeout:** The server waits up to 30 seconds for a response from the webhook endpoint. If the endpoint hangs beyond this, the request is considered failed and enters the retry loop.

**Retry on failure:** The server retries webhook delivery on failure (non-2xx, timeout, network error) until a callback claims the `wake_id` or a 2xx response transitions the consumer to LIVE. A 2xx response means the consumer is actively processing — the liveness timeout handles crash recovery.

**Webhook delivery retries** use exponential backoff (AWS standard algorithm):

- Initial retry with exponential backoff up to 30 seconds between attempts
- Then retry every 60 seconds with jitter
- Retries continue until claimed, but consumer instances are GC'd after 3 days of consecutive webhook failures (see Garbage Collection)

This ensures consumers auto-recover after deploys, outages, or bug fixes without manual intervention.

**Delivery guarantee** is at-least-once. Consumers must handle duplicate events idempotently.

**Partial failures**: If a consumer processes some events and acks progress but crashes before completing, the next wake-up resumes from the last acknowledged offset.

### Garbage Collection

Consumer instances are removed when:

- Primary stream is deleted
- Webhook errors continuously for 3 days
- Consumer unsubscribes from all streams (including primary)

When a consumer instance is removed, all its internal webhook subscriptions to secondary streams are also cleaned up.

No explicit deletion API is needed—unsubscribe handles cleanup.

### Subscription HTTP API

Subscriptions use the glob pattern as the URL path, with query parameters for CRUD operations. This keeps subscriptions as a property of the path namespace rather than a separate resource.

**Create subscription:**

```http
PUT /agents/*?subscription=agent-handler
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "webhook": "https://my-agent.workers.dev/handler",
  "description": "Agent task processor"
}

→ 201 Created
{
  "subscription_id": "agent-handler",
  "pattern": "/agents/*",
  "webhook": "https://my-agent.workers.dev/handler",
  "webhook_secret": "whsec_abc123def456...",
  "description": "Agent task processor"
}
```

The glob pattern (`/agents/*`) is the path; the subscription ID is provided via query parameter.

**Note:** The `webhook_secret` is only returned on creation. Store it securely—it cannot be retrieved later.

**URL encoding:** The `*` character is valid in URL paths but requires shell quoting (`curl 'https://.../agents/*?...'`). Servers should treat `*` and `%2A` as equivalent. Literal `*` stream names are not supported.

**List subscriptions under a pattern:**

```http
GET /agents/*?subscriptions
→ { "subscriptions": [...] }
```

**List all subscriptions (search all patterns):**

```http
GET /**?subscriptions
→ { "subscriptions": [...] }
```

**Get subscription by ID (search all patterns):**

```http
GET /**?subscription=agent-handler
→ { "subscription_id": "agent-handler", "pattern": "/agents/*", ... }
```

(Does not include `webhook_secret`)

**Delete subscription:**

```http
DELETE /agents/*?subscription=agent-handler
→ 204 No Content
```

When a subscription is deleted, all its consumer instances are immediately removed. Any in-flight callback requests will receive `410 CONSUMER_GONE`.

Subscriptions are immutable—to change the webhook URL, delete and recreate.

### State Storage

Subscription and consumer instance state lives in the same Store abstraction as stream data. This keeps the implementation simple and leverages existing persistence.

### Existing Streams

When a subscription is created and matching streams already exist:

- Consumer instances are created in IDLE state
- They wake only when new events arrive (not immediately)
- Assumption: existing streams were handled by a previous subscription/version

### Example Consumer (Serverless Function)

```typescript
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from "crypto"
import { stream } from "@durable-streams/client"

const WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET!
const PLATFORM_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000 // e.g., Cloudflare Workers limit
const IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS = 15_000 // exit if no messages for 15s
const SAFETY_MARGIN_MS = 5_000 // exit 5s before platform kills us

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request) {
    const body = await request.text()
    const signature = request.headers.get("Webhook-Signature")

    // Verify webhook signature
    if (
      !signature ||
      !verifyWebhookSignature(body, signature, WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    ) {
      return new Response("Invalid signature", { status: 401 })
    }

    const {
      consumer_id,
      epoch,
      wake_id,
      streams: initialStreams,
      callback,
      token: initialToken,
    } = JSON.parse(body)
    const startTime = Date.now()

    // Subscribe to additional streams and claim wake_id
    // First callback claims the wake and transitions WAKING → LIVE
    let token = initialToken
    let subRes = await fetch(callback, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        epoch,
        wake_id, // Claims this wake attempt
        subscribe: [
          `/shared-filesystem/${consumer_id}`,
          `/tools/${consumer_id}`,
        ],
      }),
    })

    // Check if another instance already claimed this wake
    const subBody = await subRes.json()
    if (subRes.status === 409) {
      if (subBody.error?.code === "ALREADY_CLAIMED") {
        // Another callback already claimed this wake - exit gracefully
        return new Response("Already claimed", { status: 200 })
      }
    }
    let { streams: allStreams, token: newToken } = subBody
    token = newToken

    let lastMessageTime = Date.now()
    const pendingAcks: Promise<Response>[] = []
    const controller = new AbortController()

    // Set up concurrent readers for all subscribed streams
    const readers = allStreams.map((s: { path: string; offset: string }) =>
      stream({
        url: `https://streams.example.com${s.path}`,
        offset: s.offset,
        live: true,
        signal: controller.signal,
      }).then((res) => {
        res.subscribeJson(async (batch) => {

### Security Considerations

While authentication is handled at the deployment layer, implementations should consider:

**Webhook signature verification:**

- All webhook notifications include a `Webhook-Signature` header
- Consumers should verify signatures before processing (see example above)
- Signatures include timestamps to prevent replay attacks

**Webhook URL validation (SSRF prevention):**

- Require HTTPS for webhook URLs (except localhost in development)
- Block private IP ranges (RFC 1918, link-local, loopback)
- Block cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254)
- Consider allowlisting webhook domains

**Callback token security:**

- Tokens are passed via `Authorization` header to avoid logging exposure
- Tokens should be signed JWTs with consumer_id, epoch, and expiry
- Implementations should validate token signatures on every callback

### Implementation Scope

**In scope for v1:**

- Subscription CRUD API
- Consumer instance lifecycle (IDLE → WAKING → LIVE → IDLE, and WAKING → IDLE shortcut)
- Consumer epochs and wake_ids for fencing zombie consumers and duplicate deliveries
- Webhook 2xx transitions to LIVE; retry on failure until claimed or 2xx
- Webhook signature verification
- Wake-up notifications and callback API
- Dynamic subscribe/unsubscribe for secondary streams
- Internal webhook routing for secondary subscriptions (single-server)
- Exponential backoff retry with indefinite retries
- OpenTelemetry integration in Node.js server for debugging

**Out of scope for v1:**

- Distributed server implementation (protocol supports it)
- Consumer instance listing/inspection APIs
- Complex glob patterns (character classes, negation)
- Authentication (handled at deployment layer)
- Configurable callback TTL (fixed at 1 hour for v1)

### Future Considerations

The following features are not included in v1 but may be added based on demand:

- **Backfill/replay delivery policies** — Allow subscriptions to specify `deliver_policy: "all" | "new" | "from_offset"` to control whether existing streams trigger immediate wake-ups
- **Subscription pause/resume** — Temporarily disable webhook delivery without deleting subscription state
- **Consumer instance inspection API** — Query consumer state for debugging (stats, state, last activity)
- **Configurable retry schedules** — Per-subscription retry timing configuration
- **Dead letter queue** — Capture consumer state when GC'd for inspection/replay

## Definition of Success

This feature is successful when a multi-agent system running on serverless functions works smoothly without DX friction. Specifically:

**Functional requirements:**

- Agents wake reliably when events arrive on any subscribed stream
- Dynamic subscribe/unsubscribe works correctly mid-session
- Offsets are preserved across wake cycles
- Agents can stay alive processing live events, then cleanly exit
- Failed webhooks retry indefinitely and recover automatically after deploys/fixes
- Zombie consumers are fenced via epochs
- Duplicate webhook deliveries are handled via wake_id claiming

**Developer experience:**

- Consumer code is straightforward (see example above)
- Webhook signature verification is simple to implement
- No external orchestration needed—Durable Streams handles coordination
- Debugging is tractable via OpenTelemetry traces in the Node.js server

**Out of scope for v1:**

- Distributed server implementation (protocol supports it, reference impl is single-server)
- Consumer instance listing/inspection APIs
- Complex glob patterns (character classes, negation)
- Authentication (handled at deployment layer)
